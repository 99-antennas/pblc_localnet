Shawn  arena I'm a resident of leaked city and  i'm also a city employee as well as the  president of the League City Police off  Association I want to speak tonight  about employee benefits and he'll share  it health insurance due to counsels  recent talks of raising increasing the  amount that employees pay towards their  health insurance it is customary in this  area and many others for city employees  to receive health insurance as a benefit  governmental workers take jobs at lower  wages because of job security retirement  and a solid health benefit plan many of  the city workers at leak City work at  very low wages it would be forced to  choose between paying for their own  health insurance or providing for the  families our employees took their jobs  relying on these benefits and their  ability to provide for their families  throughout their entire careers these  are not part time jobs for these people  they are career employees who serve our  citizens at a time when the city is  having difficulty recruiting and  retaining employees a two-tiered benefit  plan has talked about since mixed  signals to your non civil service  employees and ultimately works against  the city for future hiring recruiting  and retention efforts there has been  discussion about specialized quote  specialized positions and the police  department is not the only specialized  position within the city no one in the  city in the police department is a  computer programmer a wastewater expert  a street designer for a payroll expert  we are up we are Public Safety  Specialist cost of insurance is  obviously directly related to claims  city officials even elected city  officials in league city are afforded  the opportunity to be covered by the  city's health insurance I have  researched the city employees claims of  on our insurance over the past one and a  half years and have discovered that one  of the largest claims came from an  elected official not a career employ  I encourage in the interest of open  government during councils opportunity  to report we'd like to give you as our  elected representatives the opportunity  to disclose whether you are covered  under our under the city's health  insurance policy I'd like to give you  example in the city of Webster Webster  pace of webster city employees pay $72  to cover his entire family during a  month all i'm asking mr. mayor and  council is for you to support your ploys  who support the citizens elite city  thank you thank you sean the next  speaker is dr. Ron Jenkins mayor and  city council of the time dr. Ron Jenkins  I am a resident of League City and I  come here tonight to tell you that you  know that we're a relatively brand new  church in this community one of our  desires in this community is reach out  to our community to do different things  give back to the community as the  community to give us an opportunity to  be here we're certainly plan on doing  several things what they were looking at  do it is have your Easter service at the  big league dream in April but this  coming weekend I wanted to share with  you one of the things we're giving back  to our community and that is in the form  of a speaker we have a guest speaker  this coming Sunday by the name is John  popper and you have a little flyer in  front of you there Don popper is a  person has been really all over America  all over the world speaking about his  book 90 minutes in heaven as a recent  this morning is on the Today Show and  he's been on several television shows  talking about his book it's really a  great opportunity for our citizens to be  a part of that and to hear that and to  be a part of a man bunnymund Don Piper  had this experience to where he actually  actually died and came back to life  he tells about that experience so I'm  here tonight to invite you to that we  meet at Harlem entry we made at ten  o'clock on sunday morning and hyoma  trees on 3,700 foreign market 518 and I  think it would be a good event for all  of our citizens of here and also after  that to make it a wonderful event we're  going to have a meal provided for  everybody at no cost to you so if you'd  like a good working service at ten  o'clock sunny morning would love for you  to come thank you for giving me  opportunity and by and i'll catch the  foot of floor in the back of the room  here and i like to pick it up I thank  you dr. Ron and I will publicly say that  I've been to one or more your services  and you're pretty good from the pulpit  yourself so I'm sure if you're bringing  somebody in it must be very very good so  thank you so much the next speaker is  Levine Holland it that's a lil Kevin I'm  sorry Kevin Kevin Harlan is now the  appropriate time to speak go to impact  fees there sure you have three minutes  you can you can talk at the time I can  you can if you want to wait and talk  during the issue we can bring you up a  lil okay thank you alright that  concludes item number six I've been over  seven or i'd like to suspend the rules  and bring item 13 forward and you get  second look over it okay Councilman Jim  Nelson has made the motion to move item  number 13 to suspend the rules move item  number 13 up seconded by councilman Mike  Barbour and please vote on this now i'm  working tomo segments reset  try now still nothing ok trying to in to  a short hands that's what we're going to  have to do we have anybody from I seen  here ok I for is unanimous Marceau moves  item number 13 Councilman Jim Nelson  Chris while they're going this way we're  going to probably work with you and your  buddy hield Petraglia councilman jim  nelson go ahead all right Mara thank you  very much first of all I could say that  I am not participating in the health  benefits for the city of League City I  have my own and I just want to make that  a matter of record the helen hall  library non-fiction book club meets on  saturday November eighteenth a3 p.m. and  we'll discuss dispatches from the edge a  mentor war disasters and survival by  Anderson Cooper and anyone is welcome to  attend the city's annual holiday open  house and tree lighting will be held on  Thursday November 30th at the library  the open house begins at four thirty and  Santa arrives at five thirty so all your  children come on out and see Santa and  it's going to be followed by a tree  lighting in front of the library at six  thirty that's a good event and all  citizens are invited that's all I have  mayor Thank You councilman Mike Barbour  that conspire actually wasn't going to  come in tonight but I certainly will  respect mr. Adams I do not believe i  participated in a level with this city  governments health care plan if you  found out otherwise we would please let  me know i'd like to change that  paperwork my company and i'll mention is  for a reason my company provides very  nice benefits package including very  good health care my wife is on my plan  instead of being through her own primary  employer the reason i want to mention  that is because I agree with basically  everything you just said when I look at  who to work for and how companies can  retain really good retain good talent as  well as attract them sometimes it does  come down to benefits and  not supported any such a two-tier system  that was proposed I think we have to  send a message that this is a good place  to come work it might be different if we  had a wonderful climate here that set by  our political officials and and  everybody couldn't wait to come work for  league city and never wanted to leave  and obviously that just hasn't applied  so I think the benefits are an important  issue and I agree with one hundred  percent of what you say it's so thank  you I thank you calvin Tommy Collins  again thank everyone for coming out like  to say hello to said for all the years  thank you for volunteering to this city  I know many of times that in the past  said was out on fire scenes early in the  morning and as always bringing out  refreshments and in so forth to the  firefighters and under emergency  situations they'll say about I like to  say thank you very much for all your  help and being a volunteer for this city  for mr. arena again as a public safety  employee myself I understand your  concern in the police officers concerns  about health insurance I think one thing  that bothers me is sitting here tonight  looking at the insurance package we want  the best insurance for all city  employees at the lowest costs that we  can get of course there's no reason that  we should be paying more for premiums  than we shouldn't be I agree that we  need good insurance probably the best  that we can especially for civil service  employees because you put your life on  the line every day firefighters EMS and  and police officers especially but for  other city employees they're non civil  service we look at several things here I  think we have a great package right now  for insurance and health benefits when  we certainly don't want to go backwards  we certainly want to go forward but we  also have City Council members up here  have to look at the dollar and we need  to really take a close look at that if  we can get better deals out there with  the same benefits I'm all for that also  but we certainly do not want to go  backwards on your benefits i agree with  you Hunter percent I am NOT on the city  city officials insurance policy or  whatever I did not know we could even  get on it I think the last person that  got on the city insurance policy might  have been councilman Tidwell but I think  he had to pay the full premiums it's not  like what y'all have I think we were  offered it about three years ago to get  on the city insurance policy but you had  to pay our premium policy there was no  contribution from the city whatsoever if  that has changed joy please let us know  tonight but i am not only insurance but  I do support the employees and we're  going to fight to keep you insurance the  same we certainly just want to look at  it what I'm very disappointed about is  that this is crisis management at the  very last we have to choose your  insurance within a month this is a very  important and critical item that we need  to make a decision on I do believe that  we need to have workshops on this we  need to look at every option there may  be a better package that we can do for  you that's my only concern and that's  the only thing that I have a problem  with voting only policy tonight thank  you thank you again Mary [ __ ] say one  thing sir we had a city employee mr.  Farrell who lost his son this week so I  like to say we like to go out and say  suppressor mr. Farrell he's been a city  employee for I know over 20 years  and losing your gear your children has  to be hard and we need so if we might  say a prayer for chaos tonight thank you  council meeting mayor I'll say about  comments for debate Thank You councilman  chris Samuelson Thank You mr. mayor  Shawn I appreciate your comments I don't  participate in cities but Insurance  Program haven't to have no intention of  doing that said it before and I'll say  it again I agree with what mr Barber  said in a city like league city where we  do have some political turmoil and some  turnover amongst a senior level that  city officials I think one of the most  important things we can do as the city  is offer the absolute best benefits to  our employees possible that's how we're  going to keep the best employees and  that's how we're going to retain the  best employees I'm a business owner I  have been a independent business owner  for more than five years I provide full  benefits to my employees from day one  because I want them to be happy I want  them to stay and as a business decision  that's the smart thing to do I don't  think we need micromanage the city I  think that we have great department  chairs and heads and I think that that  we need to trust them that they're doing  the best things for the city I agree  with mr. cohen's we need to watch out to  make sure that the bottom line  financially is and taken care of but I  have absolutely no desire to cut any  benefits ready city employees or reduce  the existing benefits I know that we  have some employees who are new who came  here because we offer great benefits and  that's how we're going to keep them so  no don't participate in the program and  I think we've got a great city staff  thank you that concludes item number 13  and although i don't speak to layer the  meeting before i move to item number 7  i'll just clarify i'm not on the city  insurance either so just clarification  we will now move the item number seven  which is a consent agenda item 7a  through 7j go to Peru help the simsons  made a motion to approve Councilman Jim  Nelson has seconded that the voting  software he is down so allies will make  any discussion on this hearing nine  please vote for is unanimous Barbara if  I lose it in call it the beat me over  the head or something Chris major motion  and Jim second ago and Imogen air okay  all right item number eight a report  from staff okay item number nine old  business consider and take action on a  professional services agreement between  the city of League City and camp dresser  McGee pink for the design of the new  Southwest wastewater treatment plant  Barrick motion to the nine councilman  john kenya's made a motion to deny I'll  second councilman jim nelson a second to  that is up for discussion out young  america counseling well John made know  it affected John oh you know when this  first came up originally there were a  lot of different questions as to should  we go forward on this water now we  didn't have the land to we didn't have a  schedule as to what our infrastructure  expenditures and our investment timeline  was going to be and three was the  question of some kind of competitive  bidding how do we determine if this is a  good price and that's that's I think  we've got the land that's taken care of  I think staff is well on their way and  developing a capital expenditure  schedule but the third thing that's  still out there is this is almost 2  million dollars in in the eventualities  of completing this contract and I  personally think we need to go out for  bids on a professional service agreement  contract of 2 million dollars thank you  Mary Jean nothing yes sir i talked to  mr. herbert today about this and he  provided me with some information just  before the meeting but what I'd like to  do is put this out for bids  and when the bids come in i think we  need to go to a workshop discuss this  rather than and make sure we pick the  right competent to do the work the  course of price is involved in this also  but i think i think we need to make sure  that the city is protected I mean two  million dollars a lot of money and I  don't want to see and there's nothing  going to be on the ground yet when we  get that money to their company all it  is is to provide us with a service to  set up the whole bit out and plant on  the west side southwest side so I think  we need to look at this very cautiously  to make sure we we are not just throwing  money at this company I I just think  that this needs to be looked at very  closely health and sanity I noticed that  the staffs recommending approval of this  despite machines motion mr. herbert AP  are you prepared to speak but this  you can have either myself or the city's  engineer who has been involved in this  process I didn't see Jack here I just  would like to hear from one of the two  of yo why you think this is a good for  the city and why the council should  approve the existing proposal  from either VI don't done matter me you  would be almost an echo so away miss  Marie so first book would like addresses  the concept of go out or request for  competitive bids any local government  code chapter 2 2254  section 2254 03 says that government  entity may not select a provider  professional services are a group of  survivors or award a contract for the  service on the basis of competitive bids  been for the contractor services so  basically a professional is the the  local government code not specifically  tells you that you do not award  contracts based upon competitive bids  what you do base them on our item one on  the basis of demonstrated competence and  qualifications to perform the services  and 24 fair and reasonable price now  underneath there there's a b1 as a  professional fees and contractors must  be consistent with and not higher than  recommended practices of these published  by the photon professional associations  and if you if you look at this on the  basis of a demonstrated competence and  qualifications CDM is the firm has been  working in the city's wastewater  facilities for the least the six years  that I've been here they have  demonstrated their confidence they have  demonstrated their skills they are the  people who are doing and completing your  completion your your processor galmans  or treatment plant they are very near  that they have been they've been very  responsive to the staff that in Canton  we have questions so they have  repeatedly demonstrated their confidence  and their abilities to do what we've  asked them to do they also under the  company that completed our wastewater  10-year plan that we just completed  their the company did that did the  population projections and so forth  which we are basing our our construction  schedule and  quantity of costs on for the next 5-10  years they've demonstrated to us through  past performance there's their  competence available duties as far as  the basis of the fair and reasonable  price there is a formula which which  professional engineers use which  demonstrate what your feet should be is  it is somewhat simple formula that is  somewhat complex it's just a little  software program that the professional  engineers oceans Association delivers it  has numbers that have them start off the  base price and on a base fee you go up  or you go down at base fee based upon  the difficulty of the permitting process  how difficult it is to do and permitting  for a 13 million gallon per day  wastewater treatment plant is a very  complex process CDM have been involved  in this process with us in with mr.  Pfeiffer for the last four years trying  to develop a site and trying to develop  a a site which has all the amenities  which we need for the discharge point  for the treatment plan and what can can  be done they have been very involved  with staff and from the beginning of the  designers facility they're very  confidence far as their fees are their  fees this initial fee is right and a  half percent their overall theme  everything is two million dollar invite  at ten percent and this is a very  competitive feed tip of the fee start  off in like an eight percent number for  design and then you go up in there based  upon the complexity of the design this  is I wanted to show this formative thing  one is going to  is it you're looking at it there are  some judgmental decisions to make and  that you have to make upon these fees  when your clown but that is the way that  you look at these fees it is it is it  complex as a more compact here you're  dealing with what entities what  government bodies are dealing with you  you mark him in rapist and mark it up  and walk that fee down based upon this  formula set out so yes as far as staff  is concerned CDM is a very qualified  company I don't know that you find a  more qualified becoming more qualified  to design your system the CDMS is their  feed variable out based upon the  formulas that are provided for  professional services by TS PE and the  american society civil engineers yes the  formula is in like any questions so if i  understand that a CDM has worked for us  for at least six years they're working  on the dallas hammer treatment plan  you've dealt with them quite a bit over  the past and in your professional  opinion their fees are fair and  reasonable in terms of what they've been  bill in the city for at least past six  years yes that is that is correct and  you think it's in our best interest move  forward with CDM from a timing  standpoint of where we are yes i do  believe is best interest to move forward  how much time do you figure we have to  burn very low Thank You counsel  double-checking leave that on there  scroll down a little bit Jack thank you  for that answer I appreciate what you've  just talked about it makes a lot of  sense and i had just after we did this  90 days ago i had looked into it more  and spoken with some people with a lot  of experience in this area came to the  same conclusion probably the only one  thing that that i just want to hear one  final answer on so I can feel more  comfortable with this is I understand  about the competitive bid process that  we don't engage in however the these  folks were contacted in the Davis of  price could there have been one other  representative company  that you know shows similar credentials  that we could have asked for an amount  and just look at it to see how they  compare or is that considered  competitive bidding that's what I want  to get to before I can feel comfortable  because I have people to answer to if we  make this decision tonight oh yes that  that is considered when you try to  compare a large if you look at two  companies that you think are parallel  companies if the determining factor is  hey this guy's going to do this figure  this guy's going through the debt feed  that's what this right here says you're  not to do you do not make the decision  based on vu based upon confidence on  basis of demonstrated competence one of  the concerns is if we go out with a  another firm that we are have no history  with the design do you have a  demonstrated competence in what you're  doing if we were going on an equal basis  were neither we never work with any firm  we want a parade a construction that no  one we had no experience with and we  would look at the equal people and equal  representation Zanu presto qualification  and that's that's the step to do you go  to request for qualifications you get to  request for qualifications here you go  through a culling process where you go  through and then you then you go and  decide who it is you want to do your  work then you ask them for a feed if you  cannot negotiate a proper fee with them  then use you terminate your barrier with  that further notice selection secular  but we do that affirm that is just well  competent to do the work and their fee  seem to be aligned with professional  information we have well I agree with  them with the feeling that this is a lot  of money and that's a tough decision but  it's a big ticket item and now we're  officially on the clock as a meeting  that we had in the arrangement that we  entered into the agreement that we  invented so I am  I'm comfortable move forward with  psidium today at Castle Hills mr. I  think yes sir you stated that this sewer  plant is going to be a 12 or 13 million  gallon clamping correct they actually  yes eventually is this designed for them  what what this design is first phase  though it is to take this to an ultimate  design because basically what you're  having or components you designed this  component next time you have just a  parallel set of components that are  identical to the first set so that  reason the interfacing package fancy  you've got your design in place so when  we're paying for in this contract my  reading the contract it states that were  paying for a 4 million gallon sewer  plant and that's what we're designing  for it this time I know we talked about  it 12 to 13 million gallon sir plan  eventually is this designed for that 13  or only for the one mini what they will  show is phase 2 phase 3 they'll show  where it goes they have to pay the  facility for the overall total capacity  and then we're going to put this this  phase one out of the total capacity and  that's what this desire so the 1.9  million that one be paying to the  engineering firm is only for the four  million gallon design we're going to  have future tallstar guests or expenses  you do an engineering right you would  have a future what you have in the  future might be their calls for  preparing of construction bid documents  is what you could have but no more is  that a design is basic but you would  have that just for the just for the bit  ok that's the only thing I'm concerned  with is in the agreement talking under  professional fees on page one it talks  about the  a new 4.0 million gallon per day  wastewater treatment plant known as the  Southwest wastewater treatment plant I  just want to clarify that we're talking  about 12 million not a 4 million token  in the design of the first phase of this  they're going to have to lay out what  the ultimate plant facility is going to  be and as you move forward they're just  segments they're just almost like a  package plant you'll have to parallel  facilities and in the next days if we go  to 8 million you'll just use that same  piece move it over next to it go to 12  your take another way to move that  forward over that again my question in  MO will we be paying for the future  engineering coaster is this included in  this bit here the eliminators the  preliminary design and permitting or  going to be a part of this in the future  what you would pay for would be a  different bid package no where's your  basic components going to be designed  all they would be saying is hey instead  of putting this facility and point a  you'd put this facility in point B why  are we not designing our 12 ian gillan  sewer plant today is it am i cool down  the wrong path Larry I think so this  contract is for the four million gallon  plant with the expansion capability to  the 12 million the engineering design  services and the in the expansions are  middle rather than because they're all  done in this first package thank you  Mary I want you to have case someone  else okay Jim got ya just about how  actually my question was answered by mr.  herbert I appreciate that very much sir  okay thank you Jim yeah could you  clarify your the fees again it's wait  there what's the estimated cost of the  estimated cost is pointing to minute and  that's for the four million gallon that  is for that is for this phase which get  you refer meeting and the ultimate  layout ultimate design and in the  construction bid documents for the four  major gallon with the first base that's  what you get for your your two million  today ok could you scroll that down just  a little bit because before though they  on the other down  what I'm surprised that attorneys not up  there so I'm not sure about that because  we've her in the past have we ever so  we've never gone out for like a  landscape architecture we've never gone  out for bids for a landscape  architecture it what we do is go out for  RFQ right so we okay that's fine and so  we went out for RFQ is on this at some  time when they were when they were first  selected I think their problems with  this RFP program it was I wasn't here  about would imagine that we're dead  letter no I meant for this for this  project yes there are project we did not  go after an RFQ process where but in it  doesn't really say you I guess it  doesn't say you have to go out for an  RFQ that I breathe doesn't no no it does  not just that there is and on the second  page there is a procedure where say if  you don't have an experience records  with a Wicca confirm in this type of  designer and wanted to there is there is  a provision that tells you the steps  that you should take if you have not had  an experience with a ticker consultant  professional cat time  okay I mean I don't see it say anything  about an experience factor in their view  said on the first page that's on the  first page that's basis of demonstrated  competence and then scroll it up again  because I don't see where it says that  if you don't have experience with  somebody then you you go out for the RFQ  if if you have a project worrying you  have not working with a consultant on  hold or if you work the consultant you  didn't have a particularly pleasant  experience with that consultant okay and  you have a similar product before what  you would do is you would go out for or  if you used to get so we didn't even ask  we didn't go out for RFQs we didn't go  out ask other people to submit their  qualifications or abilities their  designs that they've done for other  municipalities to my knowledge we do now  okay um no again 22 million dollars for  the completed plant at projected full  capacity that they the 20 million  dollars is the projected cost for this  facility at the full meeting at four  million dollars you get then you get the  overall open build-out layout but the  design the construction documents are  only gonna be for the full game in  purple and that's the 22 million at all  if that's the 20 million cost okay and  this is the same bid this is the same  treatment plant that was on the agenda  last November and its price tag at that  time of 17 million this is the same  facility okay so four million roughly in  the last 12 months that is correct  anybody else okay the most I'm just one  of them I other council previous to us  didn't build it you know things go up  sure  I think was the fact that we hadn't  bought the land yet you know and we  didn't know what was going to happen on  the southwest side at that country and I  well if we do have the land now yes sir  and and we do have a dire need as I see  the TCEQ reports and I think its various  emergency there so now the motion of the  floor is by Councilman kini to deny and  the second is by Councilman Jim Nelson  so with no further debate all in favor  of denial please vote for izz council  Keaney and council Jim Nelson all  opposed Houston cones come from barber  and countless amazon so motion to deny  fails experimenters to prove proof sir  second one of you is either a councilman  Sanderson has made a motion to approve  seconded by Councillor and Barbara's  open for debate hearing none there I  just like to say that maybe in the in  the future that I know the camp dresser  is a is a very good company but in the  future I think council will feel a  little bit more comfortable that we're  at least look at the market I mean  there's other there's other consulting  firms and engineering firms out there  and I know they've done a lot of work  force in the last six years and that's  probably the only reason I'm going to go  with them plus plus the fact that we  have to get this sewer plant online  again we're with them to a timeline and  a crunch but again thank you  okay with no further debate the motion  is to approve by Councilman Samuelson  and second by Councilman Barbara all the  table please vote for izz councilman  combs councilman barber council Jim  Nelson Nelson miss Henderson close  Calvin John Kenney motion passes and I'd  like to thank the council for their  vision to get that pass to keep this  project moving this rare at this time  I'd make a much to suspend the rules and  move up by the 10g councilman Samuelson  has made a motion to suspend the rules  and move up 10g I think we have people  sick of that seconded by councilman Mike  Barbour please vote on it to move up 10g  all in favor is unanimous we now move to  item 10g consider and take action on  entering into a contract for employee  group health dental and vision benefits  program was mayor I like to move this  time that we followed all the  recommendations of staff at this time  for discussion second second okay  councilman Barbara made the motion to  take all the recommendations of staff at  this time would that the approval or  would that be whatever's at this time  I'll just call it approval of all those  recommendations that your discussion so  we can arrive at something so we can  talk about it okay thank you sir in sac  in the document sannisen the item is now  open for debate the deed body on council  would like to start or y'all want to  hear the presentation curve that's  earlier the frozen fish  so my name is jet ski with Williams  thank you for allowing me to give  presentation on the benefit programs and  thank you live for allowing us to serve  the city over 10 years and our capacity  as an advisory team as what I've tried  to do is I know Joyce giving you a  package of quite a bit of information  I've tried to pull this down to the key  salient points and open up discussion  and follow your advice we receive the  renewals in October October is 30 days  ahead where most carriers give you the  renewals and that's based on claims  experience through June we receive a  minute earlier the claims experience  would be from may or april and they plot  an inflationary factor which would make  the rates potentially even higher so we  try to balance that we receive those  renewals and composite of the medical  dental and vision renewals is eleven and  a half percent especially those rates  are based upon cities actually claims  experience on a seventy-eight percent  basis blended with the claims experience  of the overall block of business from  those curators especially in the medical  area on the medical plan in particular  eighty cents of every premium dollar  goes out to pay claims it's kind of how  the programs are designed so there's  twenty percent for expenses and premium  taxes and things like that  so far this year through September  ninety cents is gone out to pay clients  so if you look at it and that perfekt  that the carriers aren't making the  profits they would expect and therefore  there's a need for rate increase if we  were to go out and rebuild this quote  the quote would probably be higher  because the claims experience has gotten  worse once since the time it was good  the city's benefit levels if you look at  across using and major Metroplex here or  higher than most but the cost is the  same or lower than us so I think council  and your staff want to be congratulated  on a rare win-win situation of having  much better benefits at equal lower  costs than most people so that's a huge  positive aspect compared to the many  corporate clients since other cities  that we represent and see usually that's  not the case i would encourage you to  enjoy like King the next page gives you  a financial review it shows your current  cost  what you're looking at here is a  financial overview currently the city  spends 2.9 million dollars when the  renewals were is received by us and the  city the projected increase was 17 and a  half percent are close to 3.4 million  dollars those renewals through the  bidding process and negotiations have  been negotiated down to eleven point  five percent so you are looking at an  increase of 11.5 percent dang of various  surveys you look at within the Houston  area there is actually won yesterday's  paper projected at ten percent  increasing and employment at cost seven  to eleven is not online remember your  costs are based upon primarily your  claims experience of your employee  population on anyone else the second  part of this page shows you the premium  contributions and shows you how those  are split between the employees and the  employer employer being the city so as  you have pretty even split their  premiums in renewal so what did what did  the marketing summary revealed we  obviously went out to bid we've done  that almost every year we tend to look  at these things even during the middle  years will give us some idea based upon  playing experience where we're going to  whether it's a bidding is appropriate we  sent out 29 rfps okay poor people were  able to send them out on their own we  did it on the half the city and that we  received five min of RFPs seven dental  and five vision proposals receipt you  look at the Medical if you have a  hundred eighty percent benefit plan  which is a great than at the plant it's  not a lot of people even offer that  level of coverage anymore but we went  out ask those cures to duplicate those  that coverage level signal was able to  duplicate that plan Blue Cross could not  duplicate that  plan humana got closed but do not fight  duplicate that plan the next page will  look at end up looking at the cost  dental you have a program through that  Adele [ __ ] mr. B credential it offers a  dental plan that's a traditional and any  plan and a DM 0 which is kind of like a  dental HMO if you go to that specific  set of providers their plan is unique  because they allow you to jump back and  forth between those points the other  dental quotes were received with the  exception of Delta Dental do not allow  the ploy that freedom of choice so it's  like employee having the ability to have  two different dental plans and one a  great option vision you only spent about  thirty thousand dollars we went out to  bid looked at that spec Tara as a  quality company there's a number of  hosts division for providers that quoted  most important thing about vision is the  plan is as maybe the saying we've looked  at the networks are out there what  providers they are in conjunction with  staff spec Tara or block vision would be  a good choice for the see if you look at  the next page or if we look at the next  page you'll see just the gross cost you  know healthcare came with that 18 18 and  a half percent renewal if we look at  your claim experience using our  underwriters and actuaries we probably  justified in age and a half percent  renewal and if you looked at with the  marketplace offered they receive the  claims experience all the appropriate  data they were able to come in with some  better proposals we often see this in  our marketplace where you get someone  going in in the first year being very  aggressive we've had that same issue  happen here in the past and ironically  it was Cigna if we gave us some great  rates and then the second year  overreacted in the renewal  and increase us rates you can see  there's a number of options here cigna  sawan it came the closest to looking  like exactly like united healthcare  plane if you look at the dental plan  there's supposed to people there their  plans are not exactly the same and they  don't allow the poise of freedom of  choice with the exception of Delta  Dental being the closest one and it did  offer a slight savings over current even  though the aetna renewal is only 4.64 I  know it's a cost increase but in  comparison to everything else it's not  significant amount of money vision  vision is pretty simple no no spec Tara  a number of years which is ironically  owned by God healthcare block vision  gave us a very competitive proposal with  similar benefits and some of the same  providers so when you're trying to make  her decisions I think there are a number  of issues I would ask you to consider if  I looked at these renewals from an  underwriting actuarial perspective I  probably justified and would be  consistent of the marketplace  marketplace could be more aggressive  because they're not the incumbent  they're typically would try to get the  business and keep it for several years  you also when you're considering any  change I would actually look at the  satisfaction that's a satisfaction from  the employee's perspective and the staff  perspective the quality of the benefit  plans the selection of providers and the  cost the cost and destruction of change  versus the potential one year savings  think there are some value as an  employee of being able to know that  their doctors going to network and they  can go the physicians that they're used  to seeing over here and finally it's my  understanding the costs are less a  budgeted I think the city budget at 18  send and 311 so you've got a lot of good  options you have a great plan of  benefits at a cost that is it is in line  with the marketplace or low so I think  you're in a position many employers  would be envious oh that's all I have to  say I'm here to answer questions any  council comfortable okay so one thing  you mentioned was the current  satisfaction and so it sounds like this  provider has been doing well my question  is we have already had an indication or  how will we figure out if that  satisfaction would realize with what was  a twelve percent increase in rate with  the same provider just listening to the  voice of the people and I do hear that  quite often and they are willing for  that right increase to stay with this  carrier because i have not in my 17  years of Lake City insurance experience  seen the satisfaction rate that we have  with you know health care and I do I  have presented those numbers to staff  and they have acceptance okay thank you  Epica joy you are you basing that on a  survey that you did or just by word of  mouth or yeah okay just from other  employees it yes sir lots of people  doctors about that user you're a  consultant for the city to to find the  insurance premium source at the best and  so forth do you get paid a commission we  get a paid a fee and what is that thing  FTE is between this and the life  insurance is 24,000 55 but no  commissions are paid to you where we're  compensated by fee what we were able to  do this last year when we negotiate a  renewal is after we settled on the  carrier you guys voted we were able to  go back and further negotiation our fee  so we saved the city and additional  twenty four thousand five dollars we  have no alliance to any of these  carriers we don't care I think if you  look at our fee if it's 80 basis points  of the entire program quite frankly then  we're going to see for so long really  hadn't paid attention to it it's  probably the lowest fee we have a wall  or clients which range from companies  like christus health rural energy all  the way down to the smaller company one  thing I agree with the insurance  companies I mean I have some experience  with my other job because I certainly  worked with this on a daily basis the  only concern that I had you went out for  RFQs right and you published in the  paper how many days did you allow for  the company  to come back to I think it was a little  bit over two weeks and usually an  insurance company with a great set of  bits bags will turn around for our farm  in less than 10 days we get a priority  we have a substantial block of business  so it makes it pretty easy and we give  them all the data they need a lot of us  used to work for carriers so we know  exactly what they need put in the  pristine format and enables endeth do a  quick turn again up I playing the vote  for it due to the fact that I think we  have a timeline the issue again what  happens if we do not vote for this  package fine January don't vote for this  package tonight you would have to go out  to bid again the cleanse experience has  gotten worse use our infuse our fees to  get to get other bids your claims  experience has not gotten better it's  gotten worse so underwriting I use your  claims to reject future costs I want to  project probably higher costs we can't  guarantee that but that's probably what  would happen due to the fact of our  claim history you think our bidding  process would be worse if we went out at  this time I mean these claims come in on  monthly basis and some of that is  affected by the severity of certain  large claims and is trended the wrong  direction so i think that the renewable  even added the twelve percent number is  an aggressive number and i think the  reason one of the reasons  unitedhealthcare came off this renewals  because they've had a good relationship  with the city they value your business  and it's a piece of business they want  to keep joy could you just explain to  cancel i guess in a brief summary of  what the premium cost per employees  for council members that so in do we  also pay for retiree insurance or  anything like that just kind of a  summary and then I would like to make a  comment maybe tell you our city  administrator in the future that we  really just being an important issue I  mean I also want to look at the the  aspects of trying to make it better not  just cutting costs but making it better  if it's possible I think something in in  this aspect which is a large number that  we're paying out on insurance premiums  it really should have a workshop on that  also i'm not saying to be micromanager  with Joyce department but to go out I've  looked we have no contract as of now  with this company here which I think  you've done a wonderful job in the last  several years but best an issue in  itself going out for RFQs in 14 days I  received three phone calls from three  different companies who claimed by the  time it went out for advertisement they  had no time to come back with the RFQ I  would like to maybe see a a 30-30 day  turnaround finally we can get some other  insurance companies in here that's just  a comment to our city administrator may  be in near future but if you could just  tell us a little bit about what the  premiums with the city pays them with  the employees okay okay for the  employees and the city pays 100 percent  would pay fifty percent for dependents  the City Council members are on the plan  as far as being eligible to participate  in the group health care but they do not  receive a benefit of the premium being  pay so you pay ahead a percent of the  premium and then the retirees it's kind  of their two different levels we have a  disability retiree we have a floating  number on that there's percentage  between 5075 depending on their age at  retirement for that and they'll also for  retirees alone if they retire with 20  years of service in there between 60 and  65 years of age they are 100  cover and that's the only time a shirt  that we have it when we talk about  benefits to city employees I mean  actually almost a unit some of the  health benefits and the insurance  benefits are probably one of the best in  the area do you agree with that yes our  day ok so to claim that we're losing  employees over health benefits I just  don't see that now I will tell you if we  go down you could see a trend in the  market to maybe not hiring somebody but  I don't know too many cities that play a  hundred percent for retirees insurance  and that we did that here what three  years ago four years ago right oh goody  you're right they're very few they're  probably it's it is a dwindling market  yep my only my only problem joy was the  process that we took and again I would  like to see a longer process to see if  we could get better or maybe more  companies to bid on it not necessarily  we don't have to change any insurance  carrier just seeing what the options are  out there we did receive and I do  believe that there probably six major  carriers and we did receive bids from  the five of the six major carrier so I  felt like we had pretty much pulled in  the major carriers thank you Chris would  you make sure that first year sometime  in the first quarter we schedule a  workshop to discuss not necessarily the  biz but not the insurance and you know  the pressure will be off and we can all  talk about what type of event this would  want to offer as a city sir thank you  very much anybody else councilman got  bikini couple of questions and I agree  with mr. combs that lowering the  benefits is is not good for morale  there's no doubt about it however I  think that you cannot overcome a  negative work environment by  giving benefits you can't go out and say  you know what we're going to make better  league city a better place to work out  we're not going to deal with the  problems that we have with employee  morale except that we're just going to  give them more time off more benefits in  higher wages I think that's not a good  direction for the city and for council  people to sit up here and say that we're  going to overcome our working  environment with benefits is as is not  it selects on the need because the most  important thing is not good benefits  it's preventing its it's providing a  work environment that employees feel  good about working in there's a lot of  them and you can't really overcome one  by over compensating with another so but  I do have some questions um you went to  aetna heritage in Inuit and you  renegotiated we win and appliance float  I mean not that I'm sorry oh united  healthcare you went back to united  healthcare back to all the curators you  went back to all of them are accused  state an edge in the right to choose the  best provider aunty negation and so  united healthcare was the only one that  was long to negotiate some the others  engage into and these are the rates  these are the rates of the bottom line  okay  I'm looking at the dental plan and when  I look at the dental plan it just I mean  there's you know dental asst something  that is it's better than the vision plan  because the vision plan really doesn't  cover whole lot you know because the  cost of frames and that sort of thing  kind of program in its insurance so but  that but the dental plan is something  that's important to me and I'm just  trying to it seems to me that the Delta  Dental pays a kind of a schooling in one  case here's a molar and you know in the  current plan right the employee pays two  hundred eighty dollars time oh no excuse  me read it's it's just some kind of  previous root canal therapy now that  vision care current plan three hundred  and eighty dollars under the delta  dental just this employee would only pay  two hundred eighty dollars but what we  have two different plans canceled  indiana traditional and any player you  go to any dents you want and when you  try to compare the other clan which  especially a dental  you will you have to go to those  positions and they have five or six  pages of these school procedures and we  try to evaluate some of the more common  ones it's very difficult to evaluate it  though Delta is not a battle tournament  Delta seem to be the one that you could  either go to either plan and you could  switch it every month just cycle and  that was a leader in this marketplace  actually hadn't bought credential who  was the person who invented the dmo  product here in Houston and their plan  allows you as employees switch back and  forth between these plain Dedmon that  yes sir and what other Delta is the only  one of these others that truly allow  that otherwise when you make an election  you have to pick one plan dental plan or  the other during the time period so as  an employee you get the you could go the  HMO or the and get a level of benefits  and then say okay I really don't have  this procedure done under this plan and  go back to the other person I most  likely having two plans and you can  choose on a monthly basis where the  other carriers don't offer that option  so Delta and Edna both offer those right  and almost on every procedure Delta  charges the employee that the final  total cost of the employee is less with  Delta but I see Shawn over there is is  expressing kind of being upset about  this I'm just trying to figure out do  you want to pay less or do you want to  stay with the current one  just the way our insurance now the way  our insurance now because I'm the only  reason I'm asking you sean is because  you're the only employee that's really  gotten up and spoken about this and so  I'm going to hear your opinion right and  if other you know if other employees  would like to express their opinion if  they have something unique that sean is  not addressing that I'd like to hear  that voted in my experience working for  a city league city the way Edna is now  with the two plans HMO or the dmo if you  go to a provider that you have to go  through on the HMO I tried that in  waited three months to get an  appointment and there's 33 dentists in  the entire galveston county that you  have to go to under the DM DM 0 plan you  can go to pretty much any any dentist  you want and it works out to where I  could do that one week and then turn  around and go back if I'm happy with the  HMO the other and you heard though that  you can do that with this other plan and  not only that but it's going to cost you  less money when you go there well if  they can do that then by all means I  mean it's on paper until it's actually  till we actually have the cards in our  hand in of using it and have some some  history with them I think the history  with that McConnell speaks for itself ok  well and could could you address his  concerns regarding well I mean I think  this is the problem you have when you  you have two plans one is you have the  dmo you at about ninety six people on  the population a389 that access on a  consistent basis the DML so it affects  the smaller population that's a given  set of dentists who accepted these fees  and they're just  those Dennis come in and out they build  a practice end up having an independent  practice they like to try to they'll  make more money in the other plans so  what we're talking about ppl the PPO  you'll make more money if I Magennis  I'll typically make more money into PDF  so you tend to have more turnover and  the Dylan hmm and so that's where you  can end up with some service issues  because you have to sign people in  certain geographic area and why are you  recommending to not go with delta dental  because I mean I what's the what's what  do you think us up is a bike oh well  I'll tell you two things one is  employees are familiar with the program  they found their dentist and they like  four different person or maybe one who  dislike Delta is the one that just  started within the last 60 days an  option to move back and forth so we  don't have any proven experience with  their ability to minister of that  effectively how recently in the last 60  days the ability to jump back and forth  that's when they started there they had  the two plans but you had to LA part of  our or the other for a 12 month time  period not the ability to go back and  forth or a month ago okay Oh some of the  concerns I have and the Humana plan  seems very close to the one we have now  it actually pays more in some areas it  pays less and others but my main concern  is the employees having to switch  providers up of dental and health care  plans because you know a doctor is  somebody that you've come to trust and  that you you know you really don't want  to have to switch the the thing that we  don't have here is  is which positions are on you mana that  are also on or which positions that our  city employees currently go to or on the  umaine a plan or the cigna plan versus  the united healthcare we so we don't  have that piece of the information do we  went looked at the major facilities and  major hospitals are all long-term there  and usually the hospitals or the theater  positions of the feeder systems to those  hospitals ghazab that admitting  privileges the Humane a plan is  different than if you look at it in  network is similar with these exception  of prescription drugs our network at  page seventy percent there's a higher  deductible as well on the out of network  right but not only so they didn't find  my position they would end up going on  what percentage of our employees use out  of network why now you have a very high  satisfaction with that and I would  suspect I don't have that employment me  high satisfaction satisfaction with  providers that are probably using close  to in it and network network then level  and close to have to pull those numbers  I would not be surprised it was ninety  percent or more awesome  so there's I mean it'sit's um but you  know we're not sure are we of whether or  not if we change the night that some  employees would have to switch positions  exactly if you change however many some  employers that have to switch position  your regardless of what insurance  carrier you want I mean they all have  different networks different positions  some physicians won't come to try to  command a cell wall across Signet at  night so on so forth thank you it comes  from Jim Nelson yeah I the the the  medical I'm not too concerned about I  think I think we're on track with that  the dental i have delta them and I do  find one little problem with Delta down  some dentists in this area don't  subscribe to belton metal why I have no  idea so there's a little difficult at  times to get a dentist with delta dental  however I do have it and I the Venice  that I do work with to find it's very  good data program that's I just want to  throw that into the mix yes tically or  health care providers we're not going to  subscribe to networks it's not getting  the compensation so typically this year  anybody else motion on the floor when I  first one more comment okay so and  because it was a common address directly  to my previous comments regarding  specialized employees and it in what I  meant but I didn't mean I didn't say  really specialized employees what I said  was employees that only can that are  only working within the municipal or  some kind of government arena computer  people they can work in  a lot of different industries and so I  mean those are people we probably do  need to you know certainly try to  attract but there's other areas that can  work in a variety of over NASA you know  all kinds of places in and so I didn't  say specialized employees what I meant  to say where and in what I did say where  employees that only worked that they're  you know they're there were only jobs  for law enforcement within government I  guess I mean there are security guards  and stuff but that's what I meant by  that statement the motion on the floor  by Councilman barber for and seconded by  councilman chris anderson if there is no  further debate on this issue please vote  for is unanimous motion passes we will  it 721 we will now take a  okay we will reconvene at seven thirty  two and we had just left off at item 9b  but I understand that there or there is  one that might should have been on the  consent agenda Cynthia would film was it  I'm sorry  10-8 that someone is here for so after  this we'll go back to 9a if somebody can  make the motion mood th miss me remove  that we spend the rules at this time and  move to item teenage up thank you second  about first made by counseling barber  second by counseling Samuelson all in  favor for is unanimous we now move to  item 10 h consider and take action on  approval of a resolution consenting to  the sale and issuance of series 2006  bonds first issue for galveston county  mud number 43 and authorizing and  directing the mayor to execute in the  sea secretary to attest same for and on  behalf of the city pierre-luc took crews  council come any motion to approve  captain jim nelson second that motion it  is over for discussion marriages have  one question comes makini um who is it  on staff or our city attorney that  verifies that the conditions required to  sell the bonds of Finn myth that's  normal your finance staff I review the  documents make sure that we're not  buying any terms of the agreement on  financial size can be in mr. Duncan lamb  it's here from RBC Capital Markets East  representing the mud district number 43  I did take a look at the information  that he submitted to us as well as  passing it to our financial advisors to  Joe morrow so it is it okay dissolved in  order very good thank you any further  questions hearing none motion is to  approve please vote for is unanimous  motion passes  okay now we will go back to item 9b  consider and take action on extending  the term for the depository bid 25 years  pair of my motion to deny councilman  Combs has made the motion to deny where  else so I felt frustrated by council  makini it's open for debate health and  poems mayor the reason I do believe that  we need to go to either a three year or  five year tryna because I think it's  very time consuming for the city and  problem get better rates but extending  the period but I think about a year ago  when mr. Tidwell was on council we asked  city staff to go out to extend this one  year and to go out for accused to come  back and look at rates from other banks  and so forth I would still suggest that  we do that but let's do it for a five  year three year and a five year period  and see what kind of rates we can get  and what kind of them what should I  think that's what's kept us is true that  that's what this issue is we wanted to  request approval prior to prepare the  RFP on whether again are not you guys  wanted three years or five years so that  we would know foot to put in the RFP so  that they would respond sometimes your  rates may be significantly different  from the three to five year period I'm  sorry I'm reading it as that we're going  to stay with energy bank for another  five years is that not everybody what  you want power what's wrong or motion so  this is not to tune it to renew the  contract with Angie 45 this is just and  renew the bid 45 so that you guys to do  the RFP it's just to tell us what do you  want us to take get beads for five years  or three years okay I would like to see  both but i'll go ahead and type out my  motion  make a new motion okay or just change  that one from tonight and set yes for  three and five-year okay except  McCullough jism commended his motion to  accept for a three and five is that  clear Cynthia okay at council Keaney and  you'll keep that second sure ok any  other debate on this councilman borrow  it was just one quick question I was  recently appointed to buy you to the  Audit Committee and I don't think we've  had a meeting called yet and I just want  to make sure that as a new member i  don't really know the entire history  this look reasonable to audit committee  members is that reflect their intent so  I assumed it would I just want to make  sure thank you Chris we need to give  make sure not that there's a committee  on that as well a meeting there will be  one in during this quarter the bleep  line is already planning you she is in  the audience first any simpler to do so  okay thank you any further discussion on  this issue hearing none please vote for  is unanimous motion passes new business  item 10a considering take action on  approval of a credit card policy mayor  like to make a motion that we authorize  and improve the city administrator to  develop a credit card policy to bring  back to counsel for the January 10th  council meeting for approval okay  council McCombs has made a motion to  approve also going to the city  administrator to create a credit card  policy and bring it back to the January  tenth council meeting and that motion is  seconded by Councilman Jim Nelson and so  there are any item is now open for  debate councilman Coast Mayor the reason  I placed this only agenda after talking  with mrs. long and some of the other  city staff's I know that we used to have  a credit card policy many years ago but  I find it very hard when you try to  travel anywhere in the city on City  business just recently I tried to book a  flight for City business and you have to  put them on your personal cards you have  to get a purchase order you have to do  several things I think where we should  have a credit card policy and let city  administrator direct whoever that person  may be in charge of that policy and that  credit card but you only need a credit  card to do City business and I think  that would be very helpful to our  directors into our staff again I think  the January 10th can somebody look at a  calendar I'm sorry I'm going to have our  own calendar here for weekly my motion  should be the first council meeting in  January thanks tonight okay like to I'm  sorry I'd like to request that we may  possibly possibly be given a little bit  more time one of the things is that  number one I want to say that I'm very  differently in agreement with credit  cards and I have worked with entities  who had them in place before however  we're in the middle of hiring a  purchasing agent who which we'd like to  have them look at implementing a pcard  program which is a purchasing card but  it's the same as the credit card program  and also the program is something that  i'd like to get all of the processes and  procedures together and share with the  audit committee now because the audit  committee meeting is in december i don't  think i'll have enough time but if we  can get this person on board prior to  them and get into the audit committee  it's very important that they look at it  and review it and give us anything you  recognize that they weren't happy to a  mimosa  I forget their hearts participation here  no later than January one so we could  get it to you the first quarter of next  year for sure I bet we make it the end  of februari for him in sooner our hurry  then we can get it to you center OM  everyone with you look at it to me very  good i think that's correct I like to  amend my motion to include is it Pete  which color p card is that what's called  to include a credit card policy and peak  or policy and have it back on the agenda  for the second meeting in February okay  and councillor Nelson keeps the second  Thank You councilman barber just one  quick question whenever I see a  situation when we have an old policy I  can't help but ask what happened why do  we change it and I just want to know  what the rationale was if we already  know that it affected me researched my  understanding is that the policy has  been here but we've not been used for  the last two years when we've been  without a finance director and then  looking at the policy what's a good  policy at the time however it's a little  bit antiquated for city of this size  sampling credit card and have people  checking in either now you need to have  multiple credit cards okay so basically  a reversible using it so if even though  it's there thank you any further  definite nothing yes I just want to make  sure we have checks and balances to make  sure that there isn't helped use of  these credit cards because we did have a  problem back in the mid-1990s with some  abuse with the credit card yes sir and  I'm familiar with what happened here at  League City in addition I experienced  some problems that other entities that I  was working with and so the policy that  i will bring before you will have  numerous checks and balances there will  be no way that it can be issues examine  further discussion okay the motion is to  have the policy back to council by the  second meeting in February and also  includes the pcard okay all in favor  please vote for is unanimous motion  passes item can be we're pulling 10b the  request of  Daniel item number 10 C consider take  action to set a day for a workshop in  January 2007

Holland Cervelli is that  survey lee surreal civility Sevilla  homes inc to prepay capital covering  fees for section 6 the meadows at the  rate paid for the meadows section 1 2 3  4 and 5 me removed to a true I was  Leadership Council mccomas mad motion to  approve seconded by Councilman Jim  Nelson this item is now open for  discussion council mccomas mera like  that this time called  shalini he had a few words he would like  to address counsel with good evening  mayor and council earlier tonight  somebody talked about 90 minutes they  haven't highly recommend the book I've  been building in the league city since  2000 februari 2009 is fashion to date  here and there were before my 25 years  of homebuilding business I presented the  meadows to league city may of 2002 the  subdivision consisted of 507 lots 80 x  120 80 feet wide 520 feet deep of which  i build 100 per year so please realize  that I'm a small business about do half  of my business here in league city in  half and peril and I'm here with the  request a reasonable request to prepay  the impact fee for the last section at  the rate of that I paid sections one  through five because i believe the  capacity needed was determined at the on  start of the project with planning that  with the planning department and staff  the parkland the drainage there's no mud  in this subdivision that could not  didn't do any terms i did all this on my  own my Lots are bigger there's a less of  an impact for anchor on the city  services at the workshop that I attended  about three a while back with y'all  there are a few of the comments were  when your suppliers give you an increase  don't you just pass it on to the  customer I've never had one hundred  percent increase by supplier but when I  get increases I do my homework shop the  competition so that my product can be  reasonably priced for my customers in  this case I have 86 buyers already on  the boat  where they got contracts the impact feet  took took effect July 26 or july twenty  fifth two thousand six the house is  worried sold so the additional impact  fee is I can't be Pat I can't pass that  on to my my buyers it's going to be  burdened by by sibel homes another  comment was that everyone want to do it  well that's not true either no one  builder does this volume per subdivision  per year and no one will pony have to  this commitment because of an unsure  market and they don't submit preliminary  plans and go through the process as  early as I do or take the time to come  down here and defend themselves prior to  the previous event feet increase was  with the subdivision the whole sec all  six sections reviewed by staff and the  capacity was calculated like I said once  again all mine are sold and please I'm  requesting that you grandfather me and  let me prepay this be for your residents  a CIP is an analysis of the total  capacity the level of current usage of  commitments for usage for the existing  capital improvements over reasonable a  period of time not to exceed ten years  this was completed by staff at bunk with  the plan that I submitted four sections  one through six I'm concerned by the  need for additional capacity along with  one hundred percent increase in fees not  associated with the capacity that was  reviewed at the beginning of the  subdivision especially since the water  and sewer mains were already in place to  serve this subdivision you would not  change the parkland dedication you would  not change the drainage amount therefore  I don't believe it's a that's correct to  to change the impact fee you've got the  conceptual deal and go through it in and  at the last section is when the changes  being  and i don't i don't believe based on the  information I've looked at that it's  justified so what I'm asking is for  y'all to let me prepay and I started  this when the impact be doubled I I  started with the building departments  went through the planning department set  up a meet him to meet back here and  that's when I got the workshop so I'm  here to debt tonight as it would have  been the same time that the impact fee  doubled and I would I was requesting  that I'll pay it now in y'all half of  money that way I can keep my sales price  is the same and I don't have to go back  to the bar I can't go back to the bars  and asking for the additional money the  preliminary plat for this subdivision  was done December 23rd 2003 final was  submitted februari of 2006 was recorded  May tenth 2006 and the impact fee went  into effect you like 25th this has been  the same deal since the beginning in  2002 within a reasonable period not  exceeding 10 years as stated in chapter  3 95 to your local government code  please help me with this you all have  any questions any questions for kevin  how much money are we talking about  twenty-five hundred dollars times 100  and i'll be building now I'll be done in  july august of next year i'll be done  out of the subdivision  novartis the jellied eels I don't have  pushed from his chamber good Packer I  mean give some comment on this man you  agree with those numbers because we have  already on the ground platted over 2,000  lots in other subdivisions as well the  lakes of south shore center point  victory lakes and all the other  subdivisions that also have approved  plots with home builders who have to pay  the new rate to allow mr. Holland to pay  the old rate would make his product a  more competitive but take the  competition out of it because then he'd  be able to pay the old rate whereas the  new pump the home builders who come in  the new rate which puts him at an  advantage on their product we went  through the proper process and channels  in getting the rate increase with the  rate study the Planning and Zoning  Commission serves as the capital  improvement Advisory Committee they  published and held a public hearing the  same was done at City Council no one  spoke at either one of those public  hearings mr. Holland shows up at the  time when it was adopted and realized  that the rate of increased and decided  that he wanted you to get permission to  pay at the overage mr. Polanco could  correct me if I'm wrong but I don't  think that the state statute allows for  vesting and capital recovery fees better  that was one of the issues that we  discussed at the time when we went  through this process and at the count  time the council adopted the ordinance  they did not set any provisions for  previously approved lots if the mr.  Herbert has anything he'd like to add  for the public works side  so that those are the issues that we're  concerned about if we were to counsel  were to allow this where do you draw the  line with two thousand other lots  already platted at four thousand dollars  a pop you're giving away quite a bit of  the money to finance the improvements  that's why you increase the fee to begin  with okay for a point of clarity I asked  the city attorney does that make this  agenda item potentially illegal and  which of the engine says no but it does  open comission it doesn't make this an  illegal man but what it does is  potentially opens up the city to a  challenge in the future if you don't  grab the same allowance for someone else  you will then be challenged on the basis  and I there's there's a comment here the  data sheet about better discretion you  will be challenged on the basis that you  exercise unfettered discretion in  granting it for one or more but not to  others as your city attorney I think  this is a bad idea so legal speaking are  basically if we were to grant this  exception in this case every time one  comes up in the future if we don't grant  it when we face potential legal  challenge on why we approved this one  but not other ones yes because there are  no guidelines by which you decided to  make this decision time so when Miss  chambers says at the time that the  council passed a previous ordinance that  that increase the fees that the council  set up no Avenue or means for for  exceptions or grandfathering or anything  like that that we're basically walk  uncharted territory at this point it's  it's a due process issue if you make  decisions on how you know allowances for  one group but you don't base it on any  criteria then when someone is not  granted the same exception and you deny  it with once without once again having a  criteria or a set of guidelines by which  that decision was made then you have  exercised what's called unfettered  discretion and potentially open up the  city to a claim I you are paying me as  your city attorney to give you legal  advice I think this is a bad idea folks  setting a dangerous precedent that's  proposition they could make Chris really  are you yes yes sir in the process of  doing developments you meet with the  planning staff the developer builder  myself is is who the developer builder  is you come in and you go through asset  development review steering committee hi  whatever the terminology is it's used  here and they calculate the capacity for  the infrastructure now that was done by  the staff in the planning department  I've done nothing to change the capacity  required in mind you this is I brought  this the subdivision to the city of  League City prior to your previous  impact fee so not once but not twice but  it was reviewed the capacity was at the  old ray prior to this 2006 increase  generally speaking you review your your  impact these three to five years with  that being said I knew I had a window  came in plat of each section by section  planted the less section the capacity  required to do this subdivision has not  changed the need that the city has for  their infrastructure has changed now I  would be interpreting that  as penalizing somebody for being a good  planner and coming in dealing with the  city that's right there I can see them  i'm using mary and i don't want to do  that so do y'all have the other  questions Farrakhan marry you stated  that we had two thousand planted Lots  yes sir okay as a 2006 july two thousand  six we have on the books two thousand  platted lungs as of july two that i  don't have the actual table with me if  it was in july that we actually ended up  with that number but that's the number  we had today today but we don't know  what planet lights are from 2006 to this  day i can get that information for you  if that would impact you're just like my  whole thing here and i think mr. Harlan  has a point when we passed the CFR's you  know my intent a peasant was to  everything from that point forward would  be at the new rate everything from that  point backwards which my understanding  forgive me if I'm wrong but my  understanding was that that was the fee  schedule so I understand like new  planted Lots like tuscan lakes who came  in to us afterwards who may not be or  i'm not for sure I mean tuscan lakes  would have had some lots already planted  vijayan i like they have now a modeling  is I like to see how many plague lots we  have prior to to july two thousand six  and this would only affect that group of  people because they were under the right  that were fighting anybody pants july  two thousand six if they planted a lot  should fall under the new rate that's  like passing the city ordinance and  making a fine for  a Class C misdemeanor and say no  everybody's going to have to pay that  now instead of the people that violated  from this point forward we're going to  go back and click from these other  people I just don't think that's fair  you're quoting low you're quoting  statues that in mr. Polanco quoted this  discretion and everything else but I  just don't know how that's fair for the  people that planted there there lots  prior to July the six was on the books  here in League City and who had a set  fee they paid that fee or new that feed  was going to be part of their home price  and then after two thousand six when we  set the new rate in the new fee you have  to go back on this previous developer  and say now then lots that you previous  plated or a part of CFR I just don't  think that's fair it's like us going  back on the park dedication fee to maybe  Sasha harbor and saying we're going to  charge you now instead of the two  hundred dollars was on charge using  eight hundred dollars just because you  plated lot sir before this point that's  that's the only point with all this it  seems like there's no clear  justification from the split of July 26  2006 everything forward should be at the  new rate everything behind that ship it  to back rate and I don't think we're  talking about thousands of plat o'clock  so I would imagine you probably got some  of the whole builders like that owes  maybe summer testicle lights may be  similar I think you're basically talking  about eight million dollars one how do  you come up there if you got two  thousand planet lot set and they would  have to pay the four thousand dollar  rate twenty five hundred dollars  difference it's a twenty five hundred  dollars difference but it's a it's a  difference that's substantial when  you're talking about financing the  improvements you use when council  approved the capital improvement the  capital improvement plan sorry the  capital recovery fee and you approve the  rate study you did that based on certain  numbers that were provided in that study  those numbers did not  grandfather any existing planet lots and  so what you would be doing in essence is  you would have to make up the difference  in that money somehow in order to cover  those the cost of the improvements that  you're going to be using the capital  recovery needs to pay if that makes any  sense have a company it makes sense for  I mean let let me just add this um mr.  holland's stated that he received his  his capacity at the time that he planted  and that's not actually how the city of  league city handles that issue and I  verified that Cassidian engineer his  capacity is actually at the time he Hugh  files for his building permit and pasted  his face so he has no capacity just  because he's platic he's not as insurer  for any capacity at play I understand  what we used to charge Kepler recovery  fees at the time of clap was was  submitted not at the time of a building  permit so we've changed that in the  process too but at my whole point marion  again I appreciate you fighting for the  cause but I'm looking at I just I don't  see where that's fair to existing people  who went by the law who went by the  rules and policies and we're told one  thing and then all of a sudden because  it's council action we are now doubling  where we're more than doubling their  fees I'm talking about the existing  planted Lots that were over an approach  to July the 2006 nothing past that point  so if you're telling me 2000 lots now it  could be a thousand watts maybe 500  watts or we don't  from july-to-september on average the  Planning and Zoning Commission is  probably planning anywhere from 150 to  300 lots of month so you're still that's  that's a negligible amount of lots when  you're looking at the overall impact my  only point that I want to make is that  council is aware of the decision if they  were to grant this tonight the impacts  that they would be having on the capital  improvements program and the rate study  and crfs you're putting all of that at  jeopardy because you did approve that  rate study and you did adopt the capital  in recovery fees that's my only point  making sure that you're aware of those  issues right but we have not proved to  see our people you have not but you were  you were actually approving the CRF  amount in order to help offset those  costs and that was one of the reasons  why we waited on the rate study if I'm  correct them in councilman of barber yes  first of all I'd like to if I could get  some clarification the study by PBS and  Jay that was the basis for which we  calculate our CRF they that is done how  frequently because I remember it  actually being done to a period of time  that was a little bit expired by at  least a couple of years earlier this  year when I checked it out and I knew  that we had a new one on the way so it's  how often every five years and it seems  to take a little time between the end of  that period and when we actually get the  new one for consideration so we're  talking about more than five years and  if you look at that can you look at what  our previous CRF was and what it went to  your right it doubled it doesn't think a  mathematician figure out that if you  project linearly that the homes in the  latter part of the previous study period  were causing a bigger impact than was  previously accounted for that makes  sense to everybody i hope i'm not  violating some mathematical assumptions  in other words those homes that were in  those sections got pretty good break and  that's that's a good deal the ones that  are now in today's real time cost that  we figure out this is cost basis this  isn't what we're trying to collect out  of people's because we want to finance  bigger government this is what we have  to pay to to sort of the city and for  their fair share it happens to be more I  just look at this as the city just  saying we're happy to throw away  the million dollars today and put  ourselves at risk for up to five million  dollars total and think about how that  affects our water rates because some of  those cips are directly related to you  know the water service and service  wastewater that's going to impact our  water rates when we consider that and  over this next period of few months I  don't agree with those numbers according  million dollars is the number that  you're asking for your shade 45 45 is  the number of plants that we would be  put at risk to account for if we set  this president before I don't know that  to be true I'm saying we're at risk I'm  not saying we're handing over that and  amount tonight but we are at risk if you  don't look at it as risk you know if I'm  completely wrong with somebody in the  room with the figures in there to tell  me I'm wrong because that's the way I  look at everything I've heard tonight  deal even if without the numbers it  doesn't matter philosophically you're  correct it doesn't matter what the  numbers are what like the attorney said  we're at risk and regardless of what the  numbers are yeah I do it I understand  the whole the whole premise for which  this is found it up I just think it I  also agree it would be terrible idea for  the city to engage in you know just you  know that is the price of development  today if if in the terrible event that  the price of steel doubled and you hit  you that's that that that cost on to  your consumers and they would pay for  more expensive homes than what they  would have if they'd about a year  earlier and that's nothing anybody can  do anything but this is essentially an  analogous thing that's what's happened  that the price of building  infrastructure has gone up that much and  the people who are buying homes today  have to face that regardless of how long  the other sections that the neighborhood  they live in have been going already  based based that because concrete and  steel are on their way back down because  China is just an example of a for  instance i'm not talking about what's  happening in the press of steelton in  the world i'm talking about as i as an  example an analogy but that would tell  me is that your your treatment plants  that you're going to be putting online  their price is going to be coming down  based on the analysis that was done  previously it works exactly the opposite  okay then what happens in six months  later you know if I go by I mean it's  fluctuations are part of the premise of  the study that I think that PBS and JJ  I'm agreeing to give you the money based  on the July twentieth day and a total  amount of about a quarter million  dollars in other than what we what we  realize as is what the true costs are so  yeah we we can debate this back and  forth that's comin if you drive if you  if you pull up at the drive-in window at  McDonald's 88 99 cent for the burden  when you go to pick it up and pay for it  it's three dollars that's what's  happened here that's how that's how  simple it is but that and you know what  that analogy is correct and at that  point i would say keep your burger i'm  going next door i mean that's that's the  unfortunate circumstance that we've and  i don't think that's your attention as a  city I don't think that's what you want  to do we treat people like you want to  be treated and you don't have another  question counselor fell no no you know I  voice my opinion I just liked it at the  time that we passed the CRF we could  have placed in one city ordinance am i  right mr pongco to make the deadline  july the 26 that could have been part of  the part of the ordinance for you could  have fixed whatever schedules and  timeframes that you won't have thank you  okay the emotional I've got a couple  questions when did you first approached  the city with your prepayment idea as  soon as I wanted when I turned it in the  first eight permits of section 6 it was  quoted 2400  okay and i called the building  department went into SAP with the Sean  and then was taken through the path to  marry try to set up an appointment the  mayor he led Barry to me I discussed it  at that time nurse comments you correct  me if I'm wrong Mary you said that  sounds reasonable all that one is  reasonable okay I've got a and what do  you know what date that was well it had  to be around at twenty fifth of July and  that's when they increase went through  actually it was more into August because  I mr. Piper was still here as a matter  of fact ok I've got to start memo it's  not it's not that critical to my  decision um of the can you explain the  two thousand number again where that  number is coming from is that lots that  have been planted that's lots that have  been planted those are approved plans as  of what date again because mr. tom was  saying we update our we update our our  schedule every month after about p + z  meetings so this would be as of last  month so this is as of last October no  no last month westmark yes it's just  November that we're in so there's no  that's awful i'm sorry you're right  didn't I say October ok you say last  October which would let me believe you  meant last year no no that wasn't that  way if that was amazing we wouldn't even  have to worry about those wrongly  because they were built now so that's  2000 as of October of this year of those  two thousand hamady were planted prior  to the date that we raise the impact as  I answered earlier I don't have the  actual chart with me but i can tell you  on an average the planning is owning  commission plants anywhere from one  hundred and  300 lots of months so you know from july  to to october roughly 300 300 las amo  200 lives less so there may be 800 watts  out there that would have been approved  since july possibly yeah that's that's  just an approximation okay and in the  only reason not right now I would  probably have to vote against this  unless but there's but I think there is  something that we could do but I need to  get better numbers as to the legal  implications because it's only going to  what we've been instructed by our city  attorney is that we cannot make we  cannot have unfettered discretion when  we make this decision but I guess we  could have fettered discretion I'm  assuming that the opposite of unfettered  is better and I'm not attorneys I'm just  trying to use the attorneys language  they that he gave us here so what you're  saying mr. Paco is is that we just can't  do this willy-nilly right that we have  to do this with on some basis that we  can justify there has to be some  criteria and I think there is some  criteria here I would be glad if I could  yield from your family's bikini I would  be glad to postpone until the next  council meeting get more information if  if that is willing with most council  members up here i'd like to get all the  information certainly the statues of the  law but  think this is just an unfair if we can  get a second from mr. Nelson I think who  originally gave you a second and I  really want to real quickly because we  also we don't we also have to consider  those lots that have already paid that  were previous because we may have to  refund money to those people so I need  so we need to have that analysis as well  and so are you clear only have some time  to make it make it clear for wait a  minute Mary wait wait wait wait we don't  have to do that tonight emotion by  counsel cones is to postpone we will be  able to delouse you with data so that we  don't have to go through all that  tonight where every councilman should  let you know exactly what we want to  make a decision councilman Collins has  amended his motion to postpone i would  say postponed indefinitely okay because  i don't think we can make your next  council meeting but maybe the one after  okay Elsa you try to fit a key to my  questions or okay the motion before now  is to postpone until at least maybe the  secondary competing in December right be  meeting in December and second star  Councilman Jim Nelson we good with that  yep okay everybody in favor that please  vote for izz councilman kini barber Jim  Nelson maybe you Nelson and John Keenan  opposed is councilman chris jamison  motion passes we now move to item number  two in very much for thank you thank you  item number 10 e considering take action  concerning cities extraterritorial  jurisdiction negotiations we don't need  a lotion on this story actually I just  wanted to update you as to where we are  in the process and yes we will be asking  you for some direction before so we know  how you want us to proceed and their  preservation project motion for  presentation okay council mccomas made a  motion presentation taking account from  Barbara okay present prior to mr. Pinto  leaving he briefed you on some meetings  that he had been I'm having with city  managers from surrounding cities as well  as judge Yarborough who is chairing  these meetings and the purpose of the  meetings is to try to clean up the ET je  overlapping boundaries between all of  the adjacent cities we have a continued  of these meetings since mr. Pinto is  left we attended a meeting on october  the 10th chris reed myself and we did  have the GIS person they're with us as  well and we were there with all of the  representatives of the other cities  along with their attorney and arnold  Polanco represented the city of League  City as our attorney at that time we  discussed some of the issues that are  still active as far as ET je overlapping  boundaries just to kind of give you an  idea of what boundaries we are we going  to dim the lights a little bit so you  can kind of see where we are in a  wrinkle do a good job of helping me out  when he points to the area's the purple  area that you see there is the area  that's the ET je that's shared by League  City and clear lake shores the blue area  is clear lake shores only that's there  ET je and then there's a green area  there in its League City only that area  has frontage on FM 518 however there are  no utilities available and the nearest  sewer is at least a mile away and in the  reddish area is kima ZT j only clear  lake shores at the october 10th meeting  made a proposal to league city what  clinic shores is proposing is that  league city would release the area above  the south line of the HL MP right away  and then clear lake shores would release  to league city the part of lawrence road  that is currently shared between  shores and leak city and then league  city would release everything that's in  the green area to kemah in order for the  league city's proposal is if leaks it is  to release that green area to kemah we  would be requesting that kima released  in area to league city near babe you  that would allow League City to have  access to the Galveston Bay as you know  we do have some area there but we have  no way to access the other day so that's  one item that we will be proposing the  next issue involves Texas City I can say  that one more time I'm sorry what are  what are we asking of chemo we were  asking kima to release an area to us  that's near the Bayview subdivision that  would allow League City to have access  to the Galveston Bay as you realize we  do have an area of land that fronts the  bay but we have no access to it because  it's um owned by chemo you see the block  in the where rick is pointing we have no  access to to get to the property that  actually fronts the base so we would ask  kima to give us some access American oh  stop you right there we had access at  one time what happened to this that  corridor was not there before speaking  to the microcytic the annex a corridor  and I believe they block this and Lisa T  never  challenged we never challenged it when  kima annex that corridor some time ago  how much that land of Records ours I i  can think i think i can see it but if  you could highlight of different colors  in the yellow the yellow nicely texas  easy okay  we can provide these maps to you so you  can have them to look at at your leisure  as well we'll be continuing the meet  with the surrounding cities it sounds  like the only thing that's really  changed since the last meeting was is  that we have previously this and I'm  just discussing that the eastern part  not the Dickinson and all that but at  that time were we going to I think the  there was still some question about the  Galveston Bay property that was just  hadn't been discussed yet or figured out  but is this green area that it says  clear lake shores to league city has  that changed now that was still partly  that's still the same thing that was  previously associated right and so what  are we asking for from kemah I mean  we're asking I know what we're asking  for for FEMA what is kima asking far  from us that's different than what was  previous nothing okay this issues really  coming down to between clear lake shores  and chemo yes and I would tend to come  along as well and this is just an FYI  they may or may not get along I'm i  guess i won't stayed that tonight but  under any circumstance we can move  forward and then supposedly if we move  forward that might help sway their  opinion right but there's no guarantee  what else are there's not great but i  still go back to i mean i'll have some  major concerns because we we had  continuous continuous connectivity from  babe you too  city do you recommend that was  councilman so we can research it when  mr. Poole an accident mr. Poole Mr  Bowles own counsel we had we had  continuous access from bayview to the  league city because that was the intent  was to have drainage out to the bay  we'll go back and double-check that what  Rick and the engineering department has  done is that they pulled all of the  different annexation ordinances and try  and work with mr. Polanco to try to  track them and that's the final map that  was that was I don't see the the final I  would like to see the meetings because I  know the kemah once said that there were  some written correspondence that they  use that they couldn't show proof of the  annexation so I would like to see them  we'll go back and verify that for it for  our own and I'm based on those comments  how does this kima has I know there  hasn't been any official agreement but  as came a scene I guess have they have  they agreed in principle to release that  is that I way 146 or anything yeah  that's a you know if those meetings I  think everybody is I'm just putting  their issues out on the table and would  you say playing poker man I would say  that the game's pretty much game set  match I don't know that it's going to  happen but it's just it's really beyond  our control it really comes down to  those two cities dude does chemo want  this portion of babe use that what  they're trying to ask for actually kima  an extent and we're just proposing that  they give us an access to it they  actually haven't responded one way or  the other you're saying the green  portion is leaked city or chemo the  green portions league city are they  asking for that portion of a you know  they are not if I may the purpose of  this meeting of this tonight we've all  the members this committee are going  back to counseling and giving this  overview because it's very important  when we get down to the final agreement  that we all the council's agree on  at the same time but it's going to throw  it off so it it's important that we have  a clear understanding of all this trade  issue and as the mayor had mentioned  earlier there regardless of their  agreements sir regardless of their  agreement on the east side leak city is  planning on still going ahead with our  trades right which may be a catalyst to  complete the deal go ahead so what we're  proposing is give them the green here no  sir we're keeping the green that's ours  all right what are we proposing to give  chemo for that we're not giving kima  anything they're not asking for anything  or just remember to give us accidentally  off excess yes sir if we verify that we  don't already have I think we have okay  there's enough stuff clouded over by  years of being stuffed in a drawer i  think you know we've been trying to pull  it all out of the drawer sir to go to  the texas city dickinson area okay  currently the green that you see there  is League City see TJ the yellow is  Texas cities et J that's east of  caroline street in then Texas City annex  this area in august 2005 and it was  later determined that they have NX in an  error because it actually belongs in to  league city in our ET je and so they are  d annex in this area and mr. pentell  told you about that at the last update  so nothing has changed their texas city  is proposing to release to dickinson the  area north of dickinson city limits and  west of gum by you league city will  release all of this ET je in this area  to dickinson and lisa has no utilities  in this area and right now people are  getting services from WC ID there are  some single-family homes out there  mobile homes that  dipinto described to you at the last  meeting nothing's changed there and  areas not currently regulated by any  zoning so it's just a mishmash of  development and the Makri port is out  there within the ET je area real far  east as well how far eastern 30 TJ go  he's that's as far east as about her  come by okay let me go and and that that  is the update that we have for you  tonight and we just wanted to see in  principle let you know that nothing had  changed this is what we're still moving  forward with and to make sure that our  council is still wanting us to move in  this direction as the mayor stated a lot  of what happens between those two cities  has no bearing on what we want to do we  still need to clean up these ET je  boundaries so we can get rid of this  overlapping issues so we're doing a  [ __ ] gratis right we will free would  be happy if they were to take it off our  hands I'm something a potion or two I  guess we could make a motion then start  the discussion on whether or not we  won't staff to proceed what are you  looking for I mean that you can't are  you want well the motions on the floor  for the presentation that's all we  wanted to do tonight was just to keep  everybody a price of what well how does  that give feedback to staff that this  council is a dream to those actions  mer if I may I would like to see one  other thing I would like to see a more  defined complete mapping colored for  City Council to review i intend to drive  the area i think we have some major  concerns up here and we also invest  major concerns down the eastern in kemah  before i give up some property or ET je  to clear lake shores or chemo I mean we  have some concerns down there where that  property we're taking over I would  certainly you know like to direct staff  to continue about I don't think we're  agreeing that we want to give up the  property yet no and that's not what  we're asking for I I would like to see  more definitive maps and cover of the  entire area that we can take a drive be  played on council agenda and in the  future for poor decision I guess what we  can do councilman is

Severson of the workshop we  didn't have workshop back in november  14th of 2005 meeting along with the  joint workshop with the Planning and  Zoning Commission of City Council and a  Parks Board has there been changes no  changes forever no sir and the marsh  board approved and unanimously in  January 2006 and the Planning Commission  actually approved it in March of 2006  and I'm at the park for Denise this plan  in order to start getting new grants in  and they really want to get this crew so  they can start getting some grants into  some part work but why does that stop  married that's good for Texas Parks and  Wildlife has a requirement that you have  to have a parks plan is no older I want  to say five years and it's been since  1999 255 since you've had a parks  national plan so we haven't had any  grants from no sales no sir you haven't  applied for any any new grants in a  while because you don't not going to  Texas Parks and Wildlife because you  don't have an updated parks clean thank  you okay the most on the floors by  counseling Sanderson's who approves  seconded by councilman Mike Barbour with  no further discussion please vote for  its unanimous motion passes item 10 Jay  consider take action on an ordinance  amending ordinance number 200 356  section 102.5 110 2.59 article 2 of the  city of League cities code of ordinances  and title parks and recreation areas  some of helping Jim Nelson play the  motion to approve seconded by councilman  chris henderson it's open for debate  we're the only question I have is get to  it it's the it's the area in there that  talks about the time that 102 dash 56  and mr. chambers maybe you can kind of  mr. Cheng and help you if you could just  kind of tell me the significance and  what that what this section really means  102 dash 56 or says land shown on a  subdivision master plan by a developer  for a major recreational center school  site park or other public use shall be  reserved for a period of one year after  the preliminary plan is approved by the  sea what's the significance of this um  man can with what we've seen happening  in the past is that you will get a  master plan approval developer would  have a master plan approved and he was  set aside land or those particular uses  that you so mentioned and then would  revise his master plan and those uses  would move or get lessons so this is to  make sure that for a period of one year  we know that that land is available for  that development and then what we've  done in the subdivision orders to try to  make all these ordinances work together  is now if that master plan changes to  the extent that that land shifts we have  to have another public hearing and  notify those surrounding property owners  so you don't move into a neighborhood  thinking that you're going to have a  park and all of a sudden you don't have  part it's something else in that period  well I think that's great I'm just  concerned that maybe one years not long  is not long enough and when if the  master it says the hood is the master  plan so if they revise their master plan  and let's say remove  wanted to remove a school site for  example after one year they can does  this say that they can do that in our  one year they can then what happens is  because the this section is also within  the subdivision ordinance the parks  section is 10 chapter 1 or 2 is also our  subdivision ordinance so then that would  kick into the river what's with all  solar guys right so what we've done is  we've written into the subdivision  ordinance which is chapter 10 to that if  that does change then you have to have a  public hearing which we would notify the  surrounding property on us so that  people in the neighborhood know that  there's not going to be a school there  is the identical towards it says here  yes we what we've done is married the  two the two ordinances they were very  competing at one right now as they  currently stand there very competing  although they're animals in there yeah  this was in the previous one right and  and it's still in the current one and  I'm just concerned that that's that's it  doesn't where does it say in here about  the public hearing doesn't in this  section of the subdivision orders when  you get the new revised subdivision  ordinance which you'll get at the next  council meeting you will see where we  piggyback with the tooth but if it's  identical why don't we just have it the  one because the P&amp;C was still working on  the soap it's the same ordinance chapter  10 2 is the subdivision ordinance this  is just a portion of it okay the parks  playing parts ordinances a portion of  the sub provisional okay thank you  motion on the floor is by Councilman Jim  Nelson to approve seconded by councilman  chris henderson and with no further  discussion please vote for izz unanimous  motion passes mkay considers a catch on  the approval of a requisition for the  upgrade to the current meter reading  system laptop as well as an additional  handheld meter reading device remove  hello Jim Nelson's made motion to  approve very second that motion and  Councilman kinis second that motion open  for discussion well the question is was  why was it this one it's a legitimate  don't know if that's a good question  real heavy idea in fact you should I'm  not sure should have needed to be on the  consent agenda but I don't think it  needed to be on our council yeah so  we'll talk about that but for now it's a  it's a good question so crispy note that  please we've got it first in a second  and with no further discussion please  vote for is unanimous motion passes item  11 consider take action one ordinance  amending chapter 22 the city of League  City Code of Ordinances entitled the  buildings and building regulations by  amending article 7 section 22 33 1  through section 221 335 we're to approve  for discussion councilman cosmic motion  to approve seconded by Councilman John  Keene emotions over dispense  announcement Pelham's para have a  question for mr. lenders  this kind of song I agree with most of  the change but we're taking out the  duties of the building official is  better by looking at the exhibit under  exhibit a this exhibit a is your new  city ordinance which ER you're trying to  pass correct yes sir and you're deleting  section 22 dash 331 all the way through  335 is that correct that's correct okay  and then we're replacing it with the new  world with the new ordinance but it it  took out some of your the only thing I'm  concerned way to check out some of you  languages of the duties of building  officials I mean I understand what the  intent of the code is trying to improve  the substandard buildings that we have  in our city and so forth was their  reason why we took out 10 23 32 but  those sections will also be addressed  and unsafe structure building section  that's also kind of being adopted in the  section 108 it in that section it's not  actually in here for reference by  reference and what that does is that  gives some of those powers back to the  building can you can you show me where  you're talking about under exhibit area  you're saying yeah under unsafe  structures definition there's a  definition for that and then it goes  through okay surely sir  well i'm sorry i'm giving you  misinformation that's not that just  defines unsafe structures yeah that was  my concern Shona it looks like that we  may understand it I mean I'm not exactly  what section are you referring to where  I'm taking away the powers from us well  you're taking away section 22 dash 332  duties of the building official yes and  you're you're taking that entire article  out of the city codes and you're  adopting section 25 30 31 minimum  standards team but there's nowhere in  here I see worried is defined in the  duties of the building official back  into the new code number some way I love  them I'm somewhat concerned it looks  like you made a lower right here where  it talks about hearings I mean that it's  given me the powers to schedule their  hearings and to bring everything forward  in 22 33 34 talks about hearings the  building official may schedule here in  the for the Zoning Board I mean  basically what this ordinance is also  we're going to do is the board is going  to make the decisions on what  substandard and what's not I mean it's  taking a lot of power i would say yes  it's taking a lot of power away from the  building official and in the built in  the city staff of determining this is  substandard we're going to go out  identify those items those properties  and then we're going to bring it forward  to the board and the board will then  make those decisions so it will actually  be a board of citizens making the  decision to this staff and i agree with  that i agree with the new ordinance the  only thing I'm concerned with you are  taking the duties of the building  official completely out of the ordinance  and I don't see any reference in new  ordinance that it it gives you that  definition of I mean it states here at  the building official she'll perform  such duties as directed by the city  council mayor in the city administrators  order about the Thunder  adjustments your articles are one of the  sony Gordon's that was adopted last year  there is a total subsection in there  that discusses the building official and  his powers and duties we move that  section to the zoning ordinance that you  adopted last year what okay so it's not  in this order yet but different okay I  guess the only question I have is in  that same where you just brought that up  Shawn I guess it's the building official  shale schedule I mean that's the way  we're going to determine all right  that's correct the only way we're going  to de transcript so it's not really you  may schedule or going to shell and we  want to give everybody their due process  good intent of this ordinance instead of  the city staff making those  determinations and then get challenged  in court we would rather give them due  process through Z be a lezzie be a  determine that it is substandard and  they even have the ability to decide  timelines on when something needs to be  demoed or if they get time to come  bringing it in compliance there's  different elements that gets the board  the ability to accomplish that way and  they they'll determine that through the  definitions of unsafe structure yes sir  and through your the information that  you provide and the owner will provide  that's correct I mean the old ordnance  why we went through this process that  old ordinance was very vague and it left  a lot of area for liability for the city  I mean if we I went out and filed a lien  pour down somebody's property really we  were it was very vague on how that was  taken care of and we wanted to make it  more defined more pronounced in this  ordinance we're actually a substandard  structure is very defined in this  ordinance okay let me just take like the  very first one b1a it says when any door  I'll passageway stairway or other means  of exit is not sufficient width or is so  arranged as to provide is not so  arranged us to provide safe and adequate  means of exit in case of a fire or panic  what's the width the code requires 44  inches in most instances it depends on  if it's a residential use of commercial  use I mean will fall back to the  building codes that for those  definitions I mean those those Wiz and  doorways number of egress doors all that  stuff's in the building codes themselves  and we'll be able to fall back to those  codes to make those determinations on  how wide it needs to be here items like  that 44 inches for a commercial uses of  egress with this 44 inches and this  stills with commercial and residential  and residential I mean this is any  substandard structure could be a  commercial building our residential  building for residential use it's  usually 36 inches for a highway our  first stair motion on the floor by  Councilman cones to approve seconded by  Councilman teeny with no further debate  please vote for unanimous motion passes  they keep item 12 there's 9 13 there's  nine item 14 the mayor's comments of  just a couple of quick things I'd like  to say that chief Daniels put on a an  event this weekend this past weekend for  the veterans day work with very closely  with John Kilgore and unveiled a  monument to all of the fallen heroes  that have lived in league city I believe  there were nine and I know that a  previous administration previous council  had approved those funds

to great lengths to do  that and thank you for your efforts the  only other thing is for all the people  that have asked I got my hair cut by the  Chamber of Commerce because they got 125  new members

and staff my name is Shawn  arena I\\'m a resident of leaked city and  i\\'m also a city employee as well as the  president of the League City Police off  Association I want to speak tonight  about employee benefits and he\\'ll share  it health insurance due to counsels  recent talks of raising increasing the  amount that employees pay towards their  health insurance it is customary in this  area and many others for city employees  to receive health insurance as a benefit  governmental workers take jobs at lower  wages because of job security retirement  and a solid health benefit plan many of  the city workers at leak City work at  very low wages it would be forced to  choose between paying for their own  health insurance or providing for the  families our employees took their jobs  relying on these benefits and their  ability to provide for their families  throughout their entire careers these  are not part time jobs for these people  they are career employees who serve our  citizens at a time when the city is  having difficulty recruiting and  retaining employees a two-tiered benefit  plan has talked about since mixed  signals to your non civil service  employees and ultimately works against  the city for future hiring recruiting  and retention efforts there has been  discussion about specialized quote  specialized positions and the police  department is not the only specialized  position within the city no one in the  city in the police department is a  computer programmer a wastewater expert  a street designer for a payroll expert  we are up we are Public Safety  Specialist cost of insurance is  obviously directly related to claims  city officials even elected city  officials in league city are afforded  the opportunity to be covered by the  city\\'s health insurance I have  researched the city employees claims of  on our insurance over the past one and a  half years and have discovered that one  of the largest claims came from an  elected official not a career employ  I encourage in the interest of open  government during councils opportunity  to report we\\'d like to give you as our  elected representatives the opportunity  to disclose whether you are covered  under our under the city\\'s health  insurance policy I\\'d like to give you  example in the city of Webster Webster  pace of webster city employees pay $72  to cover

Ron and I will publicly say that  I\\'ve been to one or more your services  and you\\'re pretty good from the pulpit  yourself so I\\'m sure if you\\'re bringing  somebody in it must be very very good so  thank you so much the next speaker is  Levine Holland it that\\'s a lil Kevin I\\'m  sorry Kevin Kevin Harlan is now the  appropriate time to speak go to impact  fees there sure you have three minutes  you can you can talk at the time I can  you can if you want to wait and talk  during the issue we can bring you up a  lil okay thank you alright that  concludes item number six I\\'ve been over  seven or i\\'d like to suspend the rules  and bring item 13 forward and you get  second look over it okay Councilman Jim  Nelson has made the motion to move item  number 13 to suspend the rules move item  number 13 up seconded by councilman Mike  Barbour and please vote on this now i\\'m  working tomo segments reset  try now still nothing ok trying to in to  a short hands that\\'s what we\\'re going to  have to do we have anybody from I seen  here ok I for is unanimous Marceau moves  item number 13 Councilman Jim Nelson  Chris while they\\'re going this way we\\'re  going to probably work with you and your  buddy hield Petraglia councilman jim  nelson go ahead all right Mara thank you  very much first of all I could say that  I am not participating in the health  benefits for the city of League City I  have my own and I just want to make that  a matter of record the helen hall  library non-fiction book club meets on  saturday November eighteenth a3 p.m. and  we\\'ll discuss dispatches from the edge a  mentor war disasters and survival by  Anderson Cooper and anyone is welcome to  attend the city\\'s annual holiday open  house and tree lighting will be held on  Thursday November 30th at the library  the open house begins at four thirty and  Santa arrives at five thirty so all your  children come on out and see Santa and  it\\'s going to be followed by a tree  lighting in front of the library at six  thirty that\\'s a good event and all  citizens are invited that\\'s all I have  mayor Thank You councilman Mike Barbour  that conspire actually wasn\\'t going to  come in tonight but I certainly will  respect mr. Adams I do not believe i  participated in a level with this city  governments health care plan if you  found out otherwise we would please let  me know i\\'d like to change that  paperwork my company and i\\'ll mention is  for a reason my company provides very  nice benefits package including very  good health care my wife is on my plan  instead of being through her own primary  employer the reason i want to mention  that is because I agree with basically  everything you just said when I look at  who to work for and how companies can  retain really good retain good talent as  well as attract them sometimes it does  come down to benefits and  not supported any such a two-tier system  that was proposed I think we have to  send a message that this is a good place  to come work it might be different if we  had a wonderful climate here that set by  our political officials and and  everybody couldn\\'t wait to come work for  league city and never wanted to leave  and obviously that just hasn\\'t applied  so I think the benefits are an important  issue and I agree with one hundred  percent of what you say it\\'s so thank  you I thank you calvin Tommy Collins  again thank everyone for coming out like  to say hello to said for all the years  thank you for volunteering to this city  I know many of times that in the past  said was out on fire scenes early in the  morning and as always bringing out  refreshments and in so forth to the  firefighters and under emergency  situations they\\'ll say about I like to  say thank you very much for all your  help and being a volunteer for this city  for mr. arena again as a public safety  employee myself I understand your  concern in the police officers concerns  about health insurance I think one thing  that bothers me is sitting here tonight  looking at the insurance package we want  the best insurance for all city  employees at the lowest costs that we  can get of course there\\'s no reason that  we should be paying more for premiums  than we shouldn\\'t be I agree that we  need good insurance probably the best  that we can especially for civil service  employees because you put your life on  the line every day firefighters EMS and  and police officers especially but for  other city employees they\\'re non civil  service we look at several things here I  think we have a great package right now  for insurance and health benefits when  we certainly don\\'t want to go backwards  we certainly want to go forward but we  also have City Council members up here  have to look at the dollar and we need  to really take a close look at that if  we can get better deals out there with  the same benefits I\\'m all for that also  but we certainly do not want to go  backwards on your benefits i agree with  you Hunter percent I am NOT on the city  city officials insurance policy or  whatever I did not know we could even  get on it I think the last person that  got on the city insurance policy might  have been councilman Tidwell but I think  he had to pay the full premiums it\\'s not  like what y\\'all have I think we were  offered it about three years ago to get  on the city insurance policy but you had  to pay our premium policy there was no  contribution from the city whatsoever if  that has changed joy please let us know  tonight but i am not only insurance but  I do support the employees and we\\'re  going to fight to keep you insurance the  same we certainly just want to look at  it what I\\'m very disappointed about is  that this is crisis management at the  very last we have to choose your  insurance within a month this is a very  important and critical item that we need  to make a decision on I do believe that  we need to have workshops on this we  need to look at every option there may  be a better package that we can do for  you that\\'s my only concern and that\\'s  the only thing that I have a problem  with voting only policy tonight thank  you thank you again Mary [ __ ] say one  thing sir we had a city employee mr.  Farrell who lost his son this week so I  like to say we like to go out and say  suppressor mr. Farrell he\\'s been a city  employee for I know over 20 years  and losing your gear your children has  to be hard and we need so if we might  say a prayer for chaos tonight thank you  council meeting mayor I\\'ll say about  comments for debate Thank You councilman  chris Samuelson Thank You mr. mayor  Shawn I appreciate your comments I don\\'t  participate in cities but Insurance  Program haven\\'t to have no intention of  doing that said it before and I\\'ll say  it again I agree with what mr Barber  said in a city like league city where we  do have some political turmoil and some  turnover amongst a senior level that  city officials I think one of the most  important things we can do as the city  is offer the absolute best benefits to  our employees possible that\\'s how we\\'re  going to keep the best employees and  that\\'s how we\\'re going to retain the  best employees I\\'m a business owner I  have been a independent business owner  for more than five years I provide full  benefits to my employees from day one  because I want them to be happy I want  them to stay and as a business decision  that\\'s the smart thing to do I don\\'t  think we need micromanage the city I  think that we have great department  chairs and heads and I think that that  we need to trust them that they\\'re doing  the best things for the city I agree  with mr. cohen\\'s we need to watch out to  make sure that the bottom line  financially is and taken care of but I  have absolutely no desire to cut any  benefits ready city employees or reduce  the existing benefits I know that we  have some employees who are new who came  here because we offer great benefits and  that\\'s how we\\'re going to keep them so  no don\\'t participate in the program and  I think we\\'ve got a great city staff  thank you that concludes item number 13  and although i don\\'t speak to layer the  meeting before i move to item number 7  i\\'ll just clarify i\\'m not on the city  insurance either so just clarification  we will now move the item number seven  which is a consent agenda item 7a  through 7j go to Peru help the simsons  made a motion to approve Councilman Jim  Nelson has seconded that the voting  software he is down so allies will make  any discussion on this hearing nine  please vote for is unanimous Barbara if  I lose it in call it the beat me over  the head or something Chris major motion  and Jim second ago and Imogen air okay  all right item number eight a report  from staff okay item number nine old  business consider and take action on a  professional services agreement between  the city of League City and camp dresser  McGee pink for the design of the new  Southwest wastewater treatment plant  Barrick motion to the nine councilman  john kenya\\'s made a motion to deny I\\'ll  second councilman jim nelson a second to  that is up for discussion out young  america counseling well John made know  it affected John oh you know when this  first came up originally there were a  lot of different questions as to should  we go forward on this water now we  didn\\'t have the land to we didn\\'t have a  schedule as to what our infrastructure  expenditures and our investment timeline  was going to be and three was the  question of some kind of competitive  bidding how do we determine if this is a  good price and that\\'s that\\'s I think  we\\'ve got the land that\\'s taken care of  I think staff is well on their way and  developing a capital expenditure  schedule but the third thing that\\'s  still out there is this is almost 2  million dollars in in the eventualities  of completing this contract and I  personally think we need to go out for  bids on a professional service agreement  contract of 2 million dollars thank you  Mary Jean nothing yes sir i talked to  mr. herbert today about this and he  provided me with some information just  before the meeting but what I\\'d like to  do is put this out for bids  and when the bids come in i think we  need to go to a workshop discuss this  rather than and make sure we pick the  right competent to do the work the  course of price is involved in this also  but i think i think we need to make sure  that the city is protected I mean two  million dollars a lot of money and I  don\\'t want to see and there\\'s nothing  going to be on the ground yet when we  get that money to their company all it  is is to provide us with a service to  set up the whole bit out and plant on  the west side southwest side so I think  we need to look at this very cautiously  to make sure we we are not just throwing  money at this company I I just think  that this needs to be looked at very  closely health and sanity I noticed that  the staffs recommending approval of this  despite machines motion mr. herbert AP  are you prepared to speak but this  you can have either myself or the city\\'s  engineer who has been involved in this  process I didn\\'t see Jack here I just  would like to hear from one of the two  of yo why you think this is a good for  the city and why the council should  approve the existing proposal  from either VI don\\'t done matter me you  would be almost an echo so away miss  Marie so first book would like addresses  the concept of go out or request for  competitive bids any local government  code chapter 2 2254  section 2254 03 says that government  entity may not select a provider  professional services are a group of  survivors or award a contract for the  service on the basis of competitive bids  been for the contractor services so  basically a professional is the the  local government code not specifically  tells you that you do not award  contracts based upon competitive bids  what you do base them on our item one on  the basis of demonstrated competence and  qualifications to perform the services  and 24 fair and reasonable price now  underneath there there\\'s a b1 as a  professional fees and contractors must  be consistent with and not higher than  recommended practices of these published  by the photon professional associations  and if you if you look at this on the  basis of a demonstrated competence and  qualifications CDM is the firm has been  working in the city\\'s wastewater  facilities for the least the six years  that I\\'ve been here they have  demonstrated their confidence they have  demonstrated their skills they are the  people who are doing and completing your  completion your your processor galmans  or treatment plant they are very near  that they have been they\\'ve been very  responsive to the staff that in Canton  we have questions so they have  repeatedly demonstrated their confidence  and their abilities to do what we\\'ve  asked them to do they also under the  company that completed our wastewater  10-year plan that we just completed  their the company did that did the  population projections and so forth  which we are basing our our construction  schedule and  quantity of costs on for the next 5-10  years they\\'ve demonstrated to us through  past performance there\\'s their  competence available duties as far as  the basis of the fair and reasonable  price there is a formula which which  professional engineers use which  demonstrate what your feet should be is  it is somewhat simple formula that is  somewhat complex it\\'s just a little  software program that the professional  engineers oceans Association delivers it  has numbers that have them start off the  base price and on a base fee you go up  or you go down at base fee based upon  the difficulty of the permitting process  how difficult it is to do and permitting  for a 13 million gallon per day  wastewater treatment plant is a very  complex process CDM have been involved  in this process with us in with mr.  Pfeiffer for the last four years trying  to develop a site and trying to develop  a a site which has all the amenities  which we need for the discharge point  for the treatment plan and what can can  be done they have been very involved  with staff and from the beginning of the  designers facility they\\'re very  confidence far as their fees are their  fees this initial fee is right and a  half percent their overall theme  everything is two million dollar invite  at ten percent and this is a very  competitive feed tip of the fee start  off in like an eight percent number for  design and then you go up in there based  upon the complexity of the design this  is I wanted to show this formative thing  one is going to  is it you\\'re looking at it there are  some judgmental decisions to make and  that you have to make upon these fees  when your clown but that is the way that  you look at these fees it is it is it  complex as a more compact here you\\'re  dealing with what entities what  government bodies are dealing with you  you mark him in rapist and mark it up  and walk that fee down based upon this  formula set out so yes as far as staff  is concerned CDM is a very qualified  company I don\\'t know that you find a  more qualified becoming more qualified  to design your system the CDMS is their  feed variable out based upon the  formulas that are provided for  professional services by TS PE and the  american society civil engineers yes the  formula is in like any questions so if i  understand that a CDM has worked for us  for at least six years they\\'re working  on the dallas hammer treatment plan  you\\'ve dealt with them quite a bit over  the past and in your professional  opinion their fees are fair and  reasonable in terms of what they\\'ve been  bill in the city for at least past six  years yes that is that is correct and  you think it\\'s in our best interest move  forward with CDM from a timing  standpoint of where we are yes i do  believe is best interest to move forward  how much time do you figure we have to  burn very low Thank You counsel  double-checking leave that on there  scroll down a little bit Jack thank you  for that answer I appreciate what you\\'ve  just talked about it makes a lot of  sense and i had just after we did this  90 days ago i had looked into it more  and spoken with some people with a lot  of experience in this area came to the  same conclusion probably the only one  thing that that i just want to hear one  final answer on so I can feel more  comfortable with this is I understand  about the competitive bid process that  we don\\'t engage in however the these  folks were contacted in the Davis of  price could there have been one other  representative company  that you know shows similar credentials  that we could have asked for an amount  and just look at it to see how they  compare or is that considered  competitive bidding that\\'s what I want  to get to before I can feel comfortable  because I have people to answer to if we  make this decision tonight oh yes that  that is considered when you try to  compare a large if you look at two  companies that you think are parallel  companies if the determining factor is  hey this guy\\'s going to do this figure  this guy\\'s going through the debt feed  that\\'s what this right here says you\\'re  not to do you do not make the decision  based on vu based upon confidence on  basis of demonstrated competence one of  the concerns is if we go out with a  another firm that we are have no history  with the design do you have a  demonstrated competence in what you\\'re  doing if we were going on an equal basis  were neither we never work with any firm  we want a parade a construction that no  one we had no experience with and we  would look at the equal people and equal  representation Zanu presto qualification  and that\\'s that\\'s the step to do you go  to request for qualifications you get to  request for qualifications here you go  through a culling process where you go  through and then you then you go and  decide who it is you want to do your  work then you ask them for a feed if you  cannot negotiate a proper fee with them  then use you terminate your barrier with  that further notice selection secular  but we do that affirm that is just well  competent to do the work and their fee  seem to be aligned with professional  information we have well I agree with  them with the feeling that this is a lot  of money and that\\'s a tough decision but  it\\'s a big ticket item and now we\\'re  officially on the clock as a meeting  that we had in the arrangement that we  entered into the agreement that we  invented so I am  I\\'m comfortable move forward with  psidium today at Castle Hills mr. I  think yes sir you stated that this sewer  plant is going to be a 12 or 13 million  gallon clamping correct they actually  yes eventually is this designed for them  what what this design is first phase  though it is to take this to an ultimate  design because basically what you\\'re  having or components you designed this  component next time you have just a  parallel set of components that are  identical to the first set so that  reason the interfacing package fancy  you\\'ve got your design in place so when  we\\'re paying for in this contract my  reading the contract it states that were  paying for a 4 million gallon sewer  plant and that\\'s what we\\'re designing  for it this time I know we talked about  it 12 to 13 million gallon sir plan  eventually is this designed for that 13  or only for the one mini what they will  show is phase 2 phase 3 they\\'ll show  where it goes they have to pay the  facility for the overall total capacity  and then we\\'re going to put this this  phase one out of the total capacity and  that\\'s what this desire so the 1.9  million that one be paying to the  engineering firm is only for the four  million gallon design we\\'re going to  have future tallstar guests or expenses  you do an engineering right you would  have a future what you have in the  future might be their calls for  preparing of construction bid documents  is what you could have but no more is  that a design is basic but you would  have that just for the just for the bit  ok that\\'s the only thing I\\'m concerned  with is in the agreement talking under  professional fees on page one it talks  about the  a new 4.0 million gallon per day  wastewater treatment plant known as the  Southwest wastewater treatment plant I  just want to clarify that we\\'re talking  about 12 million not a 4 million token  in the design of the first phase of this  they\\'re going to have to lay out what  the ultimate plant facility is going to  be and as you move forward they\\'re just  segments they\\'re just almost like a  package plant you\\'ll have to parallel  facilities and in the next days if we go  to 8 million you\\'ll just use that same  piece move it over next to it go to 12  your take another way to move that  forward over that again my question in  MO will we be paying for the future  engineering coaster is this included in  this bit here the eliminators the  preliminary design and permitting or  going to be a part of this in the future  what you would pay for would be a  different bid package no where\\'s your  basic components going to be designed  all they would be saying is hey instead  of putting this facility and point a  you\\'d put this facility in point B why  are we not designing our 12 ian gillan  sewer plant today is it am i cool down  the wrong path Larry I think so this  contract is for the four million gallon  plant with the expansion capability to  the 12 million the engineering design  services and the in the expansions are  middle rather than because they\\'re all  done in this first package thank you  Mary I want you to have case someone  else okay Jim got ya just about how  actually my question was answered by mr.  herbert I appreciate that very much sir  okay thank you Jim yeah could you  clarify your the fees again it\\'s wait  there what\\'s the estimated cost of the  estimated cost is pointing to minute and  that\\'s for the four million gallon that  is for that is for this phase which get  you refer meeting and the ultimate  layout ultimate design and in the  construction bid documents for the four  major gallon with the first base that\\'s  what you get for your your two million  today ok could you scroll that down just  a little bit because before though they  on the other down  what I\\'m surprised that attorneys not up  there so I\\'m not sure about that because  we\\'ve her in the past have we ever so  we\\'ve never gone out for like a  landscape architecture we\\'ve never gone  out for bids for a landscape  architecture it what we do is go out for  RFQ right so we okay that\\'s fine and so  we went out for RFQ is on this at some  time when they were when they were first  selected I think their problems with  this RFP program it was I wasn\\'t here  about would imagine that we\\'re dead  letter no I meant for this for this  project yes there are project we did not  go after an RFQ process where but in it  doesn\\'t really say you I guess it  doesn\\'t say you have to go out for an  RFQ that I breathe doesn\\'t no no it does  not just that there is and on the second  page there is a procedure where say if  you don\\'t have an experience records  with a Wicca confirm in this type of  designer and wanted to there is there is  a provision that tells you the steps  that you should take if you have not had  an experience with a ticker consultant  professional cat time  okay I mean I don\\'t see it say anything  about an experience factor in their view  said on the first page that\\'s on the  first page that\\'s basis of demonstrated  competence and then scroll it up again  because I don\\'t see where it says that  if you don\\'t have experience with  somebody then you you go out for the RFQ  if if you have a project worrying you  have not working with a consultant on  hold or if you work the consultant you  didn\\'t have a particularly pleasant  experience with that consultant okay and  you have a similar product before what  you would do is you would go out for or  if you used to get so we didn\\'t even ask  we didn\\'t go out for RFQs we didn\\'t go  out ask other people to submit their  qualifications or abilities their  designs that they\\'ve done for other  municipalities to my knowledge we do now  okay um no again 22 million dollars for  the completed plant at projected full  capacity that they the 20 million  dollars is the projected cost for this  facility at the full meeting at four  million dollars you get then you get the  overall open build-out layout but the  design the construction documents are  only gonna be for the full game in  purple and that\\'s the 22 million at all  if that\\'s the 20 million cost okay and  this is the same bid this is the same  treatment plant that was on the agenda  last November and its price tag at that  time of 17 million this is the same  facility okay so four million roughly in  the last 12 months that is correct  anybody else okay the most I\\'m just one  of them I other council previous to us  didn\\'t build it you know things go up  sure  I think was the fact that we hadn\\'t  bought the land yet you know and we  didn\\'t know what was going to happen on  the southwest side at that country and I  well if we do have the land now yes sir  and and we do have a dire need as I see  the TCEQ reports and I think its various  emergency there so now the motion of the  floor is by Councilman kini to deny and  the second is by Councilman Jim Nelson  so with no further debate all in favor  of denial please vote for izz council  Keaney and council Jim Nelson all  opposed Houston cones come from barber  and countless amazon so motion to deny  fails experimenters to prove proof sir  second one of you is either a councilman  Sanderson has made a motion to approve  seconded by Councillor and Barbara\\'s  open for debate hearing none there I  just like to say that maybe in the in  the future that I know the camp dresser  is a is a very good company but in the  future I think council will feel a  little bit more comfortable that we\\'re  at least look at the market I mean  there\\'s other there\\'s other consulting  firms and engineering firms out there  and I know they\\'ve done a lot of work  force in the last six years and that\\'s  probably the only reason I\\'m going to go  with them plus plus the fact that we  have to get this sewer plant online  again we\\'re with them to a timeline and  a crunch but again thank you  okay with no further debate the motion  is to approve by Councilman Samuelson  and second by Councilman Barbara all the  table please vote for izz councilman  combs councilman barber council Jim  Nelson Nelson miss Henderson close  Calvin John Kenney motion passes and I\\'d  like to thank the council for their  vision to get that pass to keep this  project moving this rare at this time  I\\'d make a much to suspend the rules and  move up by the 10g councilman Samuelson  has made a motion to suspend the rules  and move up 10g I think we have people  sick of that seconded by councilman Mike  Barbour please vote on it to move up 10g  all in favor is unanimous we now move to  item 10g consider and take action on  entering into a contract for employee  group health dental and vision benefits  program was mayor I like to move this  time that we followed all the  recommendations of staff at this time  for discussion second second okay  councilman Barbara made the motion to  take all the recommendations of staff at  this time would that the approval or  would that be whatever\\'s at this time  I\\'ll just call it approval of all those  recommendations that your discussion so  we can arrive at something so we can  talk about it okay thank you sir in sac  in the document sannisen the item is now  open for debate the deed body on council  would like to start or y\\'all want to  hear the presentation curve that\\'s  earlier the frozen fish  so my name is jet ski with Williams  thank you for allowing me to give  presentation on the benefit programs and  thank you live for allowing us to serve  the city over 10 years and our capacity  as an advisory team as what I\\'ve tried  to do is I know Joyce giving you a  package of quite a bit of information  I\\'ve tried to pull this down to the key  salient points and open up discussion  and follow your advice we receive the  renewals in October October is 30 days  ahead where most carriers give you the  renewals and that\\'s based on claims  experience through June we receive a  minute earlier the claims experience  would be from may or april and they plot  an inflationary factor which would make  the rates potentially even higher so we  try to balance that we receive those  renewals and composite of the medical  dental and vision renewals is eleven and  a half percent especially those rates  are based upon cities actually claims  experience on a seventy-eight percent  basis blended with the claims experience  of the overall block of business from  those curators especially in the medical  area on the medical plan in particular  eighty cents of every premium dollar  goes out to pay claims it\\'s kind of how  the programs are designed so there\\'s  twenty percent for expenses and premium  taxes and things like that  so far this year through September  ninety cents is gone out to pay clients  so if you look at it and that perfekt  that the carriers aren\\'t making the  profits they would expect and therefore  there\\'s a need for rate increase if we  were to go out and rebuild this quote  the quote would probably be higher  because the claims experience has gotten  worse once since the time it was good  the city\\'s benefit levels if you look at  across using and major Metroplex here or  higher than most but the cost is the  same or lower than us so I think council  and your staff want to be congratulated  on a rare win-win situation of having  much better benefits at equal lower  costs than most people so that\\'s a huge  positive aspect compared to the many  corporate clients since other cities  that we represent and see usually that\\'s  not the case i would encourage you to  enjoy like King the next page gives you  a financial review it shows your current  cost  what you\\'re looking at here is a  financial overview currently the city  spends 2.9 million dollars when the  renewals were is received by us and the  city the projected increase was 17 and a  half percent are close to 3.4 million  dollars those renewals through the  bidding process and negotiations have  been negotiated down to eleven point  five percent so you are looking at an  increase of 11.5 percent dang of various  surveys you look at within the Houston  area there is actually won yesterday\\'s  paper projected at ten percent  increasing and employment at cost seven  to eleven is not online remember your  costs are based upon primarily your  claims experience of your employee  population on anyone else the second  part of this page shows you the premium  contributions and shows you how those  are split between the employees and the  employer employer being the city so as  you have pretty even split their  premiums in renewal so what did what did  the marketing summary revealed we  obviously went out to bid we\\'ve done  that almost every year we tend to look  at these things even during the middle  years will give us some idea based upon  playing experience where we\\'re going to  whether it\\'s a bidding is appropriate we  sent out 29 rfps okay poor people were  able to send them out on their own we  did it on the half the city and that we  received five min of RFPs seven dental  and five vision proposals receipt you  look at the Medical if you have a  hundred eighty percent benefit plan  which is a great than at the plant it\\'s  not a lot of people even offer that  level of coverage anymore but we went  out ask those cures to duplicate those  that coverage level signal was able to  duplicate that plan Blue Cross could not  duplicate that  plan humana got closed but do not fight  duplicate that plan the next page will  look at end up looking at the cost  dental you have a program through that  Adele [ __ ] mr. B credential it offers a  dental plan that\\'s a traditional and any  plan and a DM 0 which is kind of like a  dental HMO if you go to that specific  set of providers their plan is unique  because they allow you to jump back and  forth between those points the other  dental quotes were received with the  exception of Delta Dental do not allow  the ploy that freedom of choice so it\\'s  like employee having the ability to have  two different dental plans and one a  great option vision you only spent about  thirty thousand dollars we went out to  bid looked at that spec Tara as a  quality company there\\'s a number of  hosts division for providers that quoted  most important thing about vision is the  plan is as maybe the saying we\\'ve looked  at the networks are out there what  providers they are in conjunction with  staff spec Tara or block vision would be  a good choice for the see if you look at  the next page or if we look at the next  page you\\'ll see just the gross cost you  know healthcare came with that 18 18 and  a half percent renewal if we look at  your claim experience using our  underwriters and actuaries we probably  justified in age and a half percent  renewal and if you looked at with the  marketplace offered they receive the  claims experience all the appropriate  data they were able to come in with some  better proposals we often see this in  our marketplace where you get someone  going in in the first year being very  aggressive we\\'ve had that same issue  happen here in the past and ironically  it was Cigna if we gave us some great  rates and then the second year  overreacted in the renewal  and increase us rates you can see  there\\'s a number of options here cigna  sawan it came the closest to looking  like exactly like united healthcare  plane if you look at the dental plan  there\\'s supposed to people there their  plans are not exactly the same and they  don\\'t allow the poise of freedom of  choice with the exception of Delta  Dental being the closest one and it did  offer a slight savings over current even  though the aetna renewal is only 4.64 I  know it\\'s a cost increase but in  comparison to everything else it\\'s not  significant amount of money vision  vision is pretty simple no no spec Tara  a number of years which is ironically  owned by God healthcare block vision  gave us a very competitive proposal with  similar benefits and some of the same  providers so when you\\'re trying to make  her decisions I think there are a number  of issues I would ask you to consider if  I looked at these renewals from an  underwriting actuarial perspective I  probably justified and would be  consistent of the marketplace  marketplace could be more aggressive  because they\\'re not the incumbent  they\\'re typically would try to get the  business and keep it for several years  you also when you\\'re considering any  change I would actually look at the  satisfaction that\\'s a satisfaction from  the employee\\'s perspective and the staff  perspective the quality of the benefit  plans the selection of providers and the  cost the cost and destruction of change  versus the potential one year savings  think there are some value as an  employee of being able to know that  their doctors going to network and they  can go the physicians that they\\'re used  to seeing over here and finally it\\'s my  understanding the costs are less a  budgeted I think the city budget at 18  send and 311 so you\\'ve got a lot of good  options you have a great plan of  benefits at a cost that is it is in line  with the marketplace or low so I think  you\\'re in a position many employers  would be envious oh that\\'s all I have to  say I\\'m here to answer questions any  council comfortable okay so one thing  you mentioned was the current  satisfaction and so it sounds like this  provider has been doing well my question  is we have already had an indication or  how will we figure out if that  satisfaction would realize with what was  a twelve percent increase in rate with  the same provider just listening to the  voice of the people and I do hear that  quite often and they are willing for  that right increase to stay with this  carrier because i have not in my 17  years of Lake City insurance experience  seen the satisfaction rate that we have  with you know health care and I do I  have presented those numbers to staff  and they have acceptance okay thank you  Epica joy you are you basing that on a  survey that you did or just by word of  mouth or yeah okay just from other  employees it yes sir lots of people  doctors about that user you\\'re a  consultant for the city to to find the  insurance premium source at the best and  so forth do you get paid a commission we  get a paid a fee and what is that thing  FTE is between this and the life  insurance is 24,000 55 but no  commissions are paid to you where we\\'re  compensated by fee what we were able to  do this last year when we negotiate a  renewal is after we settled on the  carrier you guys voted we were able to  go back and further negotiation our fee  so we saved the city and additional  twenty four thousand five dollars we  have no alliance to any of these  carriers we don\\'t care I think if you  look at our fee if it\\'s 80 basis points  of the entire program quite frankly then  we\\'re going to see for so long really  hadn\\'t paid attention to it it\\'s  probably the lowest fee we have a wall  or clients which range from companies  like christus health rural energy all  the way down to the smaller company one  thing I agree with the insurance  companies I mean I have some experience  with my other job because I certainly  worked with this on a daily basis the  only concern that I had you went out for  RFQs right and you published in the  paper how many days did you allow for  the company  to come back to I think it was a little  bit over two weeks and usually an  insurance company with a great set of  bits bags will turn around for our farm  in less than 10 days we get a priority  we have a substantial block of business  so it makes it pretty easy and we give  them all the data they need a lot of us  used to work for carriers so we know  exactly what they need put in the  pristine format and enables endeth do a  quick turn again up I playing the vote  for it due to the fact that I think we  have a timeline the issue again what  happens if we do not vote for this  package fine January don\\'t vote for this  package tonight you would have to go out  to bid again the cleanse experience has  gotten worse use our infuse our fees to  get to get other bids your claims  experience has not gotten better it\\'s  gotten worse so underwriting I use your  claims to reject future costs I want to  project probably higher costs we can\\'t  guarantee that but that\\'s probably what  would happen due to the fact of our  claim history you think our bidding  process would be worse if we went out at  this time I mean these claims come in on  monthly basis and some of that is  affected by the severity of certain  large claims and is trended the wrong  direction so i think that the renewable  even added the twelve percent number is  an aggressive number and i think the  reason one of the reasons  unitedhealthcare came off this renewals  because they\\'ve had a good relationship  with the city they value your business  and it\\'s a piece of business they want  to keep joy could you just explain to  cancel i guess in a brief summary of  what the premium cost per employees  for council members that so in do we  also pay for retiree insurance or  anything like that just kind of a  summary and then I would like to make a  comment maybe tell you our city  administrator in the future that we  really just being an important issue I  mean I also want to look at the the  aspects of trying to make it better not  just cutting costs but making it better  if it\\'s possible I think something in in  this aspect which is a large number that  we\\'re paying out on insurance premiums  it really should have a workshop on that  also i\\'m not saying to be micromanager  with Joyce department but to go out I\\'ve  looked we have no contract as of now  with this company here which I think  you\\'ve done a wonderful job in the last  several years but best an issue in  itself going out for RFQs in 14 days I  received three phone calls from three  different companies who claimed by the  time it went out for advertisement they  had no time to come back with the RFQ I  would like to maybe see a a 30-30 day  turnaround finally we can get some other  insurance companies in here that\\'s just  a comment to our city administrator may  be in near future but if you could just  tell us a little bit about what the  premiums with the city pays them with  the employees okay okay for the  employees and the city pays 100 percent  would pay fifty percent for dependents  the City Council members are on the plan  as far as being eligible to participate  in the group health care but they do not  receive a benefit of the premium being  pay so you pay ahead a percent of the  premium and then the retirees it\\'s kind  of their two different levels we have a  disability retiree we have a floating  number on that there\\'s percentage  between 5075 depending on their age at  retirement for that and they\\'ll also for  retirees alone if they retire with 20  years of service in there between 60 and  65 years of age they are 100  cover and that\\'s the only time a shirt  that we have it when we talk about  benefits to city employees I mean  actually almost a unit some of the  health benefits and the insurance  benefits are probably one of the best in  the area do you agree with that yes our  day ok so to claim that we\\'re losing  employees over health benefits I just  don\\'t see that now I will tell you if we  go down you could see a trend in the  market to maybe not hiring somebody but  I don\\'t know too many cities that play a  hundred percent for retirees insurance  and that we did that here what three  years ago four years ago right oh goody  you\\'re right they\\'re very few they\\'re  probably it\\'s it is a dwindling market  yep my only my only problem joy was the  process that we took and again I would  like to see a longer process to see if  we could get better or maybe more  companies to bid on it not necessarily  we don\\'t have to change any insurance  carrier just seeing what the options are  out there we did receive and I do  believe that there probably six major  carriers and we did receive bids from  the five of the six major carrier so I  felt like we had pretty much pulled in  the major carriers thank you Chris would  you make sure that first year sometime  in the first quarter we schedule a  workshop to discuss not necessarily the  biz but not the insurance and you know  the pressure will be off and we can all  talk about what type of event this would  want to offer as a city sir thank you  very much anybody else councilman got  bikini couple of questions and I agree  with mr. combs that lowering the  benefits is is not good for morale  there\\'s no doubt about it however I  think that you cannot overcome a  negative work environment by  giving benefits you can\\'t go out and say  you know what we\\'re going to make better  league city a better place to work out  we\\'re not going to deal with the  problems that we have with employee  morale except that we\\'re just going to  give them more time off more benefits in  higher wages I think that\\'s not a good  direction for the city and for council  people to sit up here and say that we\\'re  going to overcome our working  environment with benefits is as is not  it selects on the need because the most  important thing is not good benefits  it\\'s preventing its it\\'s providing a  work environment that employees feel  good about working in there\\'s a lot of  them and you can\\'t really overcome one  by over compensating with another so but  I do have some questions um you went to  aetna heritage in Inuit and you  renegotiated we win and appliance float  I mean not that I\\'m sorry oh united  healthcare you went back to united  healthcare back to all the curators you  went back to all of them are accused  state an edge in the right to choose the  best provider aunty negation and so  united healthcare was the only one that  was long to negotiate some the others  engage into and these are the rates  these are the rates of the bottom line  okay  I\\'m looking at the dental plan and when  I look at the dental plan it just I mean  there\\'s you know dental asst something  that is it\\'s better than the vision plan  because the vision plan really doesn\\'t  cover whole lot you know because the  cost of frames and that sort of thing  kind of program in its insurance so but  that but the dental plan is something  that\\'s important to me and I\\'m just  trying to it seems to me that the Delta  Dental pays a kind of a schooling in one  case here\\'s a molar and you know in the  current plan right the employee pays two  hundred eighty dollars time oh no excuse  me read it\\'s it\\'s just some kind of  previous root canal therapy now that  vision care current plan three hundred  and eighty dollars under the delta  dental just this employee would only pay  two hundred eighty dollars but what we  have two different plans canceled  indiana traditional and any player you  go to any dents you want and when you  try to compare the other clan which  especially a dental  you will you have to go to those  positions and they have five or six  pages of these school procedures and we  try to evaluate some of the more common  ones it\\'s very difficult to evaluate it  though Delta is not a battle tournament  Delta seem to be the one that you could  either go to either plan and you could  switch it every month just cycle and  that was a leader in this marketplace  actually hadn\\'t bought credential who  was the person who invented the dmo  product here in Houston and their plan  allows you as employees switch back and  forth between these plain Dedmon that  yes sir and what other Delta is the only  one of these others that truly allow  that otherwise when you make an election  you have to pick one plan dental plan or  the other during the time period so as  an employee you get the you could go the  HMO or the and get a level of benefits  and then say okay I really don\\'t have  this procedure done under this plan and  go back to the other person I most  likely having two plans and you can  choose on a monthly basis where the  other carriers don\\'t offer that option  so Delta and Edna both offer those right  and almost on every procedure Delta  charges the employee that the final  total cost of the employee is less with  Delta but I see Shawn over there is is  expressing kind of being upset about  this I\\'m just trying to figure out do  you want to pay less or do you want to  stay with the current one  just the way our insurance now the way  our insurance now because I\\'m the only  reason I\\'m asking you sean is because  you\\'re the only employee that\\'s really  gotten up and spoken about this and so  I\\'m going to hear your opinion right and  if other you know if other employees  would like to express their opinion if  they have something unique that sean is  not addressing that I\\'d like to hear  that voted in my experience working for  a city league city the way Edna is now  with the two plans HMO or the dmo if you  go to a provider that you have to go  through on the HMO I tried that in  waited three months to get an  appointment and there\\'s 33 dentists in  the entire galveston county that you  have to go to under the DM DM 0 plan you  can go to pretty much any any dentist  you want and it works out to where I  could do that one week and then turn  around and go back if I\\'m happy with the  HMO the other and you heard though that  you can do that with this other plan and  not only that but it\\'s going to cost you  less money when you go there well if  they can do that then by all means I  mean it\\'s on paper until it\\'s actually  till we actually have the cards in our  hand in of using it and have some some  history with them I think the history  with that McConnell speaks for itself ok  well and could could you address his  concerns regarding well I mean I think  this is the problem you have when you  you have two plans one is you have the  dmo you at about ninety six people on  the population a389 that access on a  consistent basis the DML so it affects  the smaller population that\\'s a given  set of dentists who accepted these fees  and they\\'re just  those Dennis come in and out they build  a practice end up having an independent  practice they like to try to they\\'ll  make more money in the other plans so  what we\\'re talking about ppl the PPO  you\\'ll make more money if I Magennis  I\\'ll typically make more money into PDF  so you tend to have more turnover and  the Dylan hmm and so that\\'s where you  can end up with some service issues  because you have to sign people in  certain geographic area and why are you  recommending to not go with delta dental  because I mean I what\\'s the what\\'s what  do you think us up is a bike oh well  I\\'ll tell you two things one is  employees are familiar with the program  they found their dentist and they like  four different person or maybe one who  dislike Delta is the one that just  started within the last 60 days an  option to move back and forth so we  don\\'t have any proven experience with  their ability to minister of that  effectively how recently in the last 60  days the ability to jump back and forth  that\\'s when they started there they had  the two plans but you had to LA part of  our or the other for a 12 month time  period not the ability to go back and  forth or a month ago okay Oh some of the  concerns I have and the Humana plan  seems very close to the one we have now  it actually pays more in some areas it  pays less and others but my main concern  is the employees having to switch  providers up of dental and health care  plans because you know a doctor is  somebody that you\\'ve come to trust and  that you you know you really don\\'t want  to have to switch the the thing that we  don\\'t have here is  is which positions are on you mana that  are also on or which positions that our  city employees currently go to or on the  umaine a plan or the cigna plan versus  the united healthcare we so we don\\'t  have that piece of the information do we  went looked at the major facilities and  major hospitals are all long-term there  and usually the hospitals or the theater  positions of the feeder systems to those  hospitals ghazab that admitting  privileges the Humane a plan is  different than if you look at it in  network is similar with these exception  of prescription drugs our network at  page seventy percent there\\'s a higher  deductible as well on the out of network  right but not only so they didn\\'t find  my position they would end up going on  what percentage of our employees use out  of network why now you have a very high  satisfaction with that and I would  suspect I don\\'t have that employment me  high satisfaction satisfaction with  providers that are probably using close  to in it and network network then level  and close to have to pull those numbers  I would not be surprised it was ninety  percent or more awesome  so there\\'s I mean it\\'sit\\'s um but you  know we\\'re not sure are we of whether or  not if we change the night that some  employees would have to switch positions  exactly if you change however many some  employers that have to switch position  your regardless of what insurance  carrier you want I mean they all have  different networks different positions  some physicians won\\'t come to try to  command a cell wall across Signet at  night so on so forth thank you it comes  from Jim Nelson yeah I the the the  medical I\\'m not too concerned about I  think I think we\\'re on track with that  the dental i have delta them and I do  find one little problem with Delta down  some dentists in this area don\\'t  subscribe to belton metal why I have no  idea so there\\'s a little difficult at  times to get a dentist with delta dental  however I do have it and I the Venice  that I do work with to find it\\'s very  good data program that\\'s I just want to  throw that into the mix yes tically or  health care providers we\\'re not going to  subscribe to networks it\\'s not getting  the compensation so typically this year  anybody else motion on the floor when I  first one more comment okay so and  because it was a common address directly  to my previous comments regarding  specialized employees and it in what I  meant but I didn\\'t mean I didn\\'t say  really specialized employees what I said  was employees that only can that are  only working within the municipal or  some kind of government arena computer  people they can work in  a lot of different industries and so I  mean those are people we probably do  need to you know certainly try to  attract but there\\'s other areas that can  work in a variety of over NASA you know  all kinds of places in and so I didn\\'t  say specialized employees what I meant  to say where and in what I did say where  employees that only worked that they\\'re  you know they\\'re there were only jobs  for law enforcement within government I  guess I mean there are security guards  and stuff but that\\'s what I meant by  that statement the motion on the floor  by Councilman barber for and seconded by  councilman chris anderson if there is no  further debate on this issue please vote  for is unanimous motion passes we will  it 721 we will now take a  okay we will reconvene at seven thirty  two and we had just left off at item 9b  but I understand that there or there is  one that might should have been on the  consent agenda Cynthia would film was it  I\\'m sorry  10-8 that someone is here for so after  this we\\'ll go back to 9a if somebody can  make the motion mood th miss me remove  that we spend the rules at this time and  move to item teenage up thank you second  about first made by counseling barber  second by counseling Samuelson all in  favor for is unanimous we now move to  item 10 h consider and take action on  approval of a resolution consenting to  the sale and issuance of series 2006  bonds first issue for galveston county  mud number 43 and authorizing and  directing the mayor to execute in the  sea secretary to attest same for and on  behalf of the city pierre-luc took crews  council come any motion to approve  captain jim nelson second that motion it  is over for discussion marriages have  one question comes makini um who is it  on staff or our city attorney that  verifies that the conditions required to  sell the bonds of Finn myth that\\'s  normal your finance staff I review the  documents make sure that we\\'re not  buying any terms of the agreement on  financial size can be in mr. Duncan lamb  it\\'s here from RBC Capital Markets East  representing the mud district number 43  I did take a look at the information  that he submitted to us as well as  passing it to our financial advisors to  Joe morrow so it is it okay dissolved in  order very good thank you any further  questions hearing none motion is to  approve please vote for is unanimous  motion passes  okay now we will go back to item 9b  consider and take action on extending  the term for the depository bid 25 years  pair of my motion to deny councilman  Combs has made the motion to deny where  else so I felt frustrated by council  makini it\\'s open for debate health and  poems mayor the reason I do believe that  we need to go to either a three year or  five year tryna because I think it\\'s  very time consuming for the city and  problem get better rates but extending  the period but I think about a year ago  when mr. Tidwell was on council we asked  city staff to go out to extend this one  year and to go out for accused to come  back and look at rates from other banks  and so forth I would still suggest that  we do that but let\\'s do it for a five  year three year and a five year period  and see what kind of rates we can get  and what kind of them what should I  think that\\'s what\\'s kept us is true that  that\\'s what this issue is we wanted to  request approval prior to prepare the  RFP on whether again are not you guys  wanted three years or five years so that  we would know foot to put in the RFP so  that they would respond sometimes your  rates may be significantly different  from the three to five year period I\\'m  sorry I\\'m reading it as that we\\'re going  to stay with energy bank for another  five years is that not everybody what  you want power what\\'s wrong or motion so  this is not to tune it to renew the  contract with Angie 45 this is just and  renew the bid 45 so that you guys to do  the RFP it\\'s just to tell us what do you  want us to take get beads for five years  or three years okay I would like to see  both but i\\'ll go ahead and type out my  motion  make a new motion okay or just change  that one from tonight and set yes for  three and five-year okay except  McCullough jism commended his motion to  accept for a three and five is that  clear Cynthia okay at council Keaney and  you\\'ll keep that second sure ok any  other debate on this councilman borrow  it was just one quick question I was  recently appointed to buy you to the  Audit Committee and I don\\'t think we\\'ve  had a meeting called yet and I just want  to make sure that as a new member i  don\\'t really know the entire history  this look reasonable to audit committee  members is that reflect their intent so  I assumed it would I just want to make  sure thank you Chris we need to give  make sure not that there\\'s a committee  on that as well a meeting there will be  one in during this quarter the bleep  line is already planning you she is in  the audience first any simpler to do so  okay thank you any further discussion on  this issue hearing none please vote for  is unanimous motion passes new business  item 10a considering take action on  approval of a credit card policy mayor  like to make a motion that we authorize  and improve the city administrator to  develop a credit card policy to bring  back to counsel for the January 10th  council meeting for approval okay  council McCombs has made a motion to  approve also going to the city  administrator to create a credit card  policy and bring it back to the January  tenth council meeting and that motion is  seconded by Councilman Jim Nelson and so  there are any item is now open for  debate councilman Coast Mayor the reason  I placed this only agenda after talking  with mrs. long and some of the other  city staff\\'s I know that we used to have  a credit card policy many years ago but  I find it very hard when you try to  travel anywhere in the city on City  business just recently I tried to book a  flight for City business and you have to  put them on your personal cards you have  to get a purchase order you have to do  several things I think where we should  have a credit card policy and let city  administrator direct whoever that person  may be in charge of that policy and that  credit card but you only need a credit  card to do City business and I think  that would be very helpful to our  directors into our staff again I think  the January 10th can somebody look at a  calendar I\\'m sorry I\\'m going to have our  own calendar here for weekly my motion  should be the first council meeting in  January thanks tonight okay like to I\\'m  sorry I\\'d like to request that we may  possibly possibly be given a little bit  more time one of the things is that  number one I want to say that I\\'m very  differently in agreement with credit  cards and I have worked with entities  who had them in place before however  we\\'re in the middle of hiring a  purchasing agent who which we\\'d like to  have them look at implementing a pcard  program which is a purchasing card but  it\\'s the same as the credit card program  and also the program is something that  i\\'d like to get all of the processes and  procedures together and share with the  audit committee now because the audit  committee meeting is in december i don\\'t  think i\\'ll have enough time but if we  can get this person on board prior to  them and get into the audit committee  it\\'s very important that they look at it  and review it and give us anything you  recognize that they weren\\'t happy to a  mimosa  I forget their hearts participation here  no later than January one so we could  get it to you the first quarter of next  year for sure I bet we make it the end  of februari for him in sooner our hurry  then we can get it to you center OM  everyone with you look at it to me very  good i think that\\'s correct I like to  amend my motion to include is it Pete  which color p card is that what\\'s called  to include a credit card policy and peak  or policy and have it back on the agenda  for the second meeting in February okay  and councillor Nelson keeps the second  Thank You councilman barber just one  quick question whenever I see a  situation when we have an old policy I  can\\'t help but ask what happened why do  we change it and I just want to know  what the rationale was if we already  know that it affected me researched my  understanding is that the policy has  been here but we\\'ve not been used for  the last two years when we\\'ve been  without a finance director and then  looking at the policy what\\'s a good  policy at the time however it\\'s a little  bit antiquated for city of this size  sampling credit card and have people  checking in either now you need to have  multiple credit cards okay so basically  a reversible using it so if even though  it\\'s there thank you any further  definite nothing yes I just want to make  sure we have checks and balances to make  sure that there isn\\'t helped use of  these credit cards because we did have a  problem back in the mid-1990s with some  abuse with the credit card yes sir and  I\\'m familiar with what happened here at  League City in addition I experienced  some problems that other entities that I  was working with and so the policy that  i will bring before you will have  numerous checks and balances there will  be no way that it can be issues examine  further discussion okay the motion is to  have the policy back to council by the  second meeting in February and also  includes the pcard okay all in favor  please vote for is unanimous motion  passes item can be we\\'re pulling 10b the  request of  Daniel item number 10 C consider take  action to set a day for a workshop in  January 2007 to review Economic  Development Corporation funding  recommendation somebody have your  calendars I think most you guys have  probably seen this presentation already  there lyrid I guess I believe at this  time that we set that deep renovation  motion at least thank you thank you my  own counsel for Barbara\\'s made a motion  to set this day and seconded by the  councilman Samuelson yes okay it\\'s now  over for discussion now let\\'s get out of  our calendars 15 januari to monday to

the night great okay all right well  let\\'s go to about the 23rd it\\'s my job  what is your urgency  where we want to be sure and get this to  the council before work it\\'s you know  the recommendation is ready we don\\'t  want this to be bandied about before you  here straight from us plus we won\\'t stay  away from the election period that  starts fairly soon after after first  year

Holland Cervelli is that  survey lee surreal civility Sevilla  homes inc to prepay capital covering  fees for section 6 the meadows at the  rate paid for the meadows section 1 2 3  4 and 5 me removed to a true I was  Leadership Council mccomas mad motion to  approve seconded by Councilman Jim  Nelson this item is now open for  discussion council mccomas mera like  that this time called  shalini he had a few words he would like  to address counsel with good evening  mayor and council earlier tonight  somebody talked about 90 minutes they  haven\\'t highly recommend the book I\\'ve  been building in the league city since  2000 februari 2009 is fashion to date  here and there were before my 25 years  of homebuilding business I presented the  meadows to league city may of 2002 the  subdivision consisted of 507 lots 80 x  120 80 feet wide 520 feet deep of which  i build 100 per year so please realize  that I\\'m a small business about do half  of my business here in league city in  half and peril and I\\'m here with the  request a reasonable request to prepay  the impact fee for the last section at  the rate of that I paid sections one  through five because i believe the  capacity needed was determined at the on  start of the project with planning that  with the planning department and staff  the parkland the drainage there\\'s no mud  in this subdivision that could not  didn\\'t do any terms i did all this on my  own my Lots are bigger there\\'s a less of  an impact for anchor on the city  services at the workshop that I attended  about three a while back with y\\'all  there are a few of the comments were  when your suppliers give you an increase  don\\'t you just pass it on to the  customer I\\'ve never had one hundred  percent increase by supplier but when I  get increases I do my homework shop the  competition so that my product can be  reasonably priced for my customers in  this case I have 86 buyers already on  the boat  where they got contracts the impact feet  took took effect July 26 or july twenty  fifth two thousand six the house is  worried sold so the additional impact  fee is I can\\'t be Pat I can\\'t pass that  on to my my buyers it\\'s going to be  burdened by by sibel homes another  comment was that everyone want to do it  well that\\'s not true either no one  builder does this volume per subdivision  per year and no one will pony have to  this commitment because of an unsure  market and they don\\'t submit preliminary  plans and go through the process as  early as I do or take the time to come  down here and defend themselves prior to  the previous event feet increase was  with the subdivision the whole sec all  six sections reviewed by staff and the  capacity was calculated like I said once  again all mine are sold and please I\\'m  requesting that you grandfather me and  let me prepay this be for your residents  a CIP is an analysis of the total  capacity the level of current usage of  commitments for usage for the existing  capital improvements over reasonable a  period of time not to exceed ten years  this was completed by staff at bunk with  the plan that I submitted four sections  one through six I\\'m concerned by the  need for additional capacity along with  one hundred percent increase in fees not  associated with the capacity that was  reviewed at the beginning of the  subdivision especially since the water  and sewer mains were already in place to  serve this subdivision you would not  change the parkland dedication you would  not change the drainage amount therefore  I don\\'t believe it\\'s a that\\'s correct to  to change the impact fee you\\'ve got the  conceptual deal and go through it in and  at the last section is when the changes  being  and i don\\'t i don\\'t believe based on the  information I\\'ve looked at that it\\'s  justified so what I\\'m asking is for  y\\'all to let me prepay and I started  this when the impact be doubled I I  started with the building departments  went through the planning department set  up a meet him to meet back here and  that\\'s when I got the workshop so I\\'m  here to debt tonight as it would have  been the same time that the impact fee  doubled and I would I was requesting  that I\\'ll pay it now in y\\'all half of  money that way I can keep my sales price  is the same and I don\\'t have to go back  to the bar I can\\'t go back to the bars  and asking for the additional money the  preliminary plat for this subdivision  was done December 23rd 2003 final was  submitted februari of 2006 was recorded  May tenth 2006 and the impact fee went  into effect you like 25th this has been  the same deal since the beginning in  2002 within a reasonable period not  exceeding 10 years as stated in chapter  3 95 to your local government code  please help me with this you all have  any questions any questions for kevin  how much money are we talking about  twenty-five hundred dollars times 100  and i\\'ll be building now I\\'ll be done in  july august of next year i\\'ll be done  out of the subdivision  novartis the jellied eels I don\\'t have  pushed from his chamber good Packer I  mean give some comment on this man you  agree with those numbers because we have  already on the ground platted over 2,000  lots in other subdivisions as well the  lakes of south shore center point  victory lakes and all the other  subdivisions that also have approved  plots with home builders who have to pay  the new rate to allow mr. Holland to pay  the old rate would make his product a  more competitive but take the  competition out of it because then he\\'d  be able to pay the old rate whereas the  new pump the home builders who come in  the new rate which puts him at an  advantage on their product we went  through the proper process and channels  in getting the rate increase with the  rate study the Planning and Zoning  Commission serves as the capital  improvement Advisory Committee they  published and held a public hearing the  same was done at City Council no one  spoke at either one of those public  hearings mr. Holland shows up at the  time when it was adopted and realized  that the rate of increased and decided  that he wanted you to get permission to  pay at the overage mr. Polanco could  correct me if I\\'m wrong but I don\\'t  think that the state statute allows for  vesting and capital recovery fees better  that was one of the issues that we  discussed at the time when we went  through this process and at the count  time the council adopted the ordinance  they did not set any provisions for  previously approved lots if the mr.  Herbert has anything he\\'d like to add  for the public works side  so that those are the issues that we\\'re  concerned about if we were to counsel  were to allow this where do you draw the  line with two thousand other lots  already platted at four thousand dollars  a pop you\\'re giving away quite a bit of  the money to finance the improvements  that\\'s why you increase the fee to begin  with okay for a point of clarity I asked  the city attorney does that make this  agenda item potentially illegal and  which of the engine says no but it does  open comission it doesn\\'t make this an  illegal man but what it does is  potentially opens up the city to a  challenge in the future if you don\\'t  grab the same allowance for someone else  you will then be challenged on the basis  and I there\\'s there\\'s a comment here the  data sheet about better discretion you  will be challenged on the basis that you  exercise unfettered discretion in  granting it for one or more but not to  others as your city attorney I think  this is a bad idea so legal speaking are  basically if we were to grant this  exception in this case every time one  comes up in the future if we don\\'t grant  it when we face potential legal  challenge on why we approved this one  but not other ones yes because there are  no guidelines by which you decided to  make this decision time so when Miss  chambers says at the time that the  council passed a previous ordinance that  that increase the fees that the council  set up no Avenue or means for for  exceptions or grandfathering or anything  like that that we\\'re basically walk  uncharted territory at this point it\\'s  it\\'s a due process issue if you make  decisions on how you know allowances for  one group but you don\\'t base it on any  criteria then when someone is not  granted the same exception and you deny  it with once without once again having a  criteria or a set of guidelines by which  that decision was made then you have  exercised what\\'s called unfettered  discretion and potentially open up the  city to a claim I you are paying me as  your city attorney to give you legal  advice I think this is a bad idea folks  setting a dangerous precedent that\\'s  proposition they could make Chris really  are you yes yes sir in the process of  doing developments you meet with the  planning staff the developer builder  myself is is who the developer builder  is you come in and you go through asset  development review steering committee hi  whatever the terminology is it\\'s used  here and they calculate the capacity for  the infrastructure now that was done by  the staff in the planning department  I\\'ve done nothing to change the capacity  required in mind you this is I brought  this the subdivision to the city of  League City prior to your previous  impact fee so not once but not twice but  it was reviewed the capacity was at the  old ray prior to this 2006 increase  generally speaking you review your your  impact these three to five years with  that being said I knew I had a window  came in plat of each section by section  planted the less section the capacity  required to do this subdivision has not  changed the need that the city has for  their infrastructure has changed now I  would be interpreting that  as penalizing somebody for being a good  planner and coming in dealing with the  city that\\'s right there I can see them  i\\'m using mary and i don\\'t want to do  that so do y\\'all have the other  questions Farrakhan marry you stated  that we had two thousand planted Lots  yes sir okay as a 2006 july two thousand  six we have on the books two thousand  platted lungs as of july two that i  don\\'t have the actual table with me if  it was in july that we actually ended up  with that number but that\\'s the number  we had today today but we don\\'t know  what planet lights are from 2006 to this  day i can get that information for you  if that would impact you\\'re just like my  whole thing here and i think mr. Harlan  has a point when we passed the CFR\\'s you  know my intent a peasant was to  everything from that point forward would  be at the new rate everything from that  point backwards which my understanding  forgive me if I\\'m wrong but my  understanding was that that was the fee  schedule so I understand like new  planted Lots like tuscan lakes who came  in to us afterwards who may not be or  i\\'m not for sure I mean tuscan lakes  would have had some lots already planted  vijayan i like they have now a modeling  is I like to see how many plague lots we  have prior to to july two thousand six  and this would only affect that group of  people because they were under the right  that were fighting anybody pants july  two thousand six if they planted a lot  should fall under the new rate that\\'s  like passing the city ordinance and  making a fine for  a Class C misdemeanor and say no  everybody\\'s going to have to pay that  now instead of the people that violated  from this point forward we\\'re going to  go back and click from these other  people I just don\\'t think that\\'s fair  you\\'re quoting low you\\'re quoting  statues that in mr. Polanco quoted this  discretion and everything else but I  just don\\'t know how that\\'s fair for the  people that planted there there lots  prior to July the six was on the books  here in League City and who had a set  fee they paid that fee or new that feed  was going to be part of their home price  and then after two thousand six when we  set the new rate in the new fee you have  to go back on this previous developer  and say now then lots that you previous  plated or a part of CFR I just don\\'t  think that\\'s fair it\\'s like us going  back on the park dedication fee to maybe  Sasha harbor and saying we\\'re going to  charge you now instead of the two  hundred dollars was on charge using  eight hundred dollars just because you  plated lot sir before this point that\\'s  that\\'s the only point with all this it  seems like there\\'s no clear  justification from the split of July 26  2006 everything forward should be at the  new rate everything behind that ship it  to back rate and I don\\'t think we\\'re  talking about thousands of plat o\\'clock  so I would imagine you probably got some  of the whole builders like that owes  maybe summer testicle lights may be  similar I think you\\'re basically talking  about eight million dollars one how do  you come up there if you got two  thousand planet lot set and they would  have to pay the four thousand dollar  rate twenty five hundred dollars  difference it\\'s a twenty five hundred  dollars difference but it\\'s a it\\'s a  difference that\\'s substantial when  you\\'re talking about financing the  improvements you use when council  approved the capital improvement the  capital improvement plan sorry the  capital recovery fee and you approve the  rate study you did that based on certain  numbers that were provided in that study  those numbers did not  grandfather any existing planet lots and  so what you would be doing in essence is  you would have to make up the difference  in that money somehow in order to cover  those the cost of the improvements that  you\\'re going to be using the capital  recovery needs to pay if that makes any  sense have a company it makes sense for  I mean let let me just add this um mr.  holland\\'s stated that he received his  his capacity at the time that he planted  and that\\'s not actually how the city of  league city handles that issue and I  verified that Cassidian engineer his  capacity is actually at the time he Hugh  files for his building permit and pasted  his face so he has no capacity just  because he\\'s platic he\\'s not as insurer  for any capacity at play I understand  what we used to charge Kepler recovery  fees at the time of clap was was  submitted not at the time of a building  permit so we\\'ve changed that in the  process too but at my whole point marion  again I appreciate you fighting for the  cause but I\\'m looking at I just I don\\'t  see where that\\'s fair to existing people  who went by the law who went by the  rules and policies and we\\'re told one  thing and then all of a sudden because  it\\'s council action we are now doubling  where we\\'re more than doubling their  fees I\\'m talking about the existing  planted Lots that were over an approach  to July the 2006 nothing past that point  so if you\\'re telling me 2000 lots now it  could be a thousand watts maybe 500  watts or we don\\'t  from july-to-september on average the  Planning and Zoning Commission is  probably planning anywhere from 150 to  300 lots of month so you\\'re still that\\'s  that\\'s a negligible amount of lots when  you\\'re looking at the overall impact my  only point that I want to make is that  council is aware of the decision if they  were to grant this tonight the impacts  that they would be having on the capital  improvements program and the rate study  and crfs you\\'re putting all of that at  jeopardy because you did approve that  rate study and you did adopt the capital  in recovery fees that\\'s my only point  making sure that you\\'re aware of those  issues right but we have not proved to  see our people you have not but you were  you were actually approving the CRF  amount in order to help offset those  costs and that was one of the reasons  why we waited on the rate study if I\\'m  correct them in councilman of barber yes  first of all I\\'d like to if I could get  some clarification the study by PBS and  Jay that was the basis for which we  calculate our CRF they that is done how  frequently because I remember it  actually being done to a period of time  that was a little bit expired by at  least a couple of years earlier this  year when I checked it out and I knew  that we had a new one on the way so it\\'s  how often every five years and it seems  to take a little time between the end of  that period and when we actually get the  new one for consideration so we\\'re  talking about more than five years and  if you look at that can you look at what  our previous CRF was and what it went to  your right it doubled it doesn\\'t think a  mathematician figure out that if you  project linearly that the homes in the  latter part of the previous study period  were causing a bigger impact than was  previously accounted for that makes  sense to everybody i hope i\\'m not  violating some mathematical assumptions  in other words those homes that were in  those sections got pretty good break and  that\\'s that\\'s a good deal the ones that  are now in today\\'s real time cost that  we figure out this is cost basis this  isn\\'t what we\\'re trying to collect out  of people\\'s because we want to finance  bigger government this is what we have  to pay to to sort of the city and for  their fair share it happens to be more I  just look at this as the city just  saying we\\'re happy to throw away  the million dollars today and put  ourselves at risk for up to five million  dollars total and think about how that  affects our water rates because some of  those cips are directly related to you  know the water service and service  wastewater that\\'s going to impact our  water rates when we consider that and  over this next period of few months I  don\\'t agree with those numbers according  million dollars is the number that  you\\'re asking for your shade 45 45 is  the number of plants that we would be  put at risk to account for if we set  this president before I don\\'t know that  to be true I\\'m saying we\\'re at risk I\\'m  not saying we\\'re handing over that and  amount tonight but we are at risk if you  don\\'t look at it as risk you know if I\\'m  completely wrong with somebody in the  room with the figures in there to tell  me I\\'m wrong because that\\'s the way I  look at everything I\\'ve heard tonight  deal even if without the numbers it  doesn\\'t matter philosophically you\\'re  correct it doesn\\'t matter what the  numbers are what like the attorney said  we\\'re at risk and regardless of what the  numbers are yeah I do it I understand  the whole the whole premise for which  this is found it up I just think it I  also agree it would be terrible idea for  the city to engage in you know just you  know that is the price of development  today if if in the terrible event that  the price of steel doubled and you hit  you that\\'s that that that cost on to  your consumers and they would pay for  more expensive homes than what they  would have if they\\'d about a year  earlier and that\\'s nothing anybody can  do anything but this is essentially an  analogous thing that\\'s what\\'s happened  that the price of building  infrastructure has gone up that much and  the people who are buying homes today  have to face that regardless of how long  the other sections that the neighborhood  they live in have been going already  based based that because concrete and  steel are on their way back down because  China is just an example of a for  instance i\\'m not talking about what\\'s  happening in the press of steelton in  the world i\\'m talking about as i as an  example an analogy but that would tell  me is that your your treatment plants  that you\\'re going to be putting online  their price is going to be coming down  based on the analysis that was done  previously it works exactly the opposite  okay then what happens in six months  later you know if I go by I mean it\\'s  fluctuations are part of the premise of  the study that I think that PBS and JJ  I\\'m agreeing to give you the money based  on the July twentieth day and a total  amount of about a quarter million  dollars in other than what we what we  realize as is what the true costs are so  yeah we we can debate this back and  forth that\\'s comin if you drive if you  if you pull up at the drive-in window at  McDonald\\'s 88 99 cent for the burden  when you go to pick it up and pay for it  it\\'s three dollars that\\'s what\\'s  happened here that\\'s how that\\'s how  simple it is but that and you know what  that analogy is correct and at that  point i would say keep your burger i\\'m  going next door i mean that\\'s that\\'s the  unfortunate circumstance that we\\'ve and  i don\\'t think that\\'s your attention as a  city I don\\'t think that\\'s what you want  to do we treat people like you want to  be treated and you don\\'t have another  question counselor fell no no you know I  voice my opinion I just liked it at the  time that we passed the CRF we could  have placed in one city ordinance am i  right mr pongco to make the deadline  july the 26 that could have been part of  the part of the ordinance for you could  have fixed whatever schedules and  timeframes that you won\\'t have thank you  okay the emotional I\\'ve got a couple  questions when did you first approached  the city with your prepayment idea as  soon as I wanted when I turned it in the  first eight permits of section 6 it was  quoted 2400  okay and i called the building  department went into SAP with the Sean  and then was taken through the path to  marry try to set up an appointment the  mayor he led Barry to me I discussed it  at that time nurse comments you correct  me if I\\'m wrong Mary you said that  sounds reasonable all that one is  reasonable okay I\\'ve got a and what do  you know what date that was well it had  to be around at twenty fifth of July and  that\\'s when they increase went through  actually it was more into August because  I mr. Piper was still here as a matter  of fact ok I\\'ve got to start memo it\\'s  not it\\'s not that critical to my  decision um of the can you explain the  two thousand number again where that  number is coming from is that lots that  have been planted that\\'s lots that have  been planted those are approved plans as  of what date again because mr. tom was  saying we update our we update our our  schedule every month after about p + z  meetings so this would be as of last  month so this is as of last October no  no last month westmark yes it\\'s just  November that we\\'re in so there\\'s no  that\\'s awful i\\'m sorry you\\'re right  didn\\'t I say October ok you say last  October which would let me believe you  meant last year no no that wasn\\'t that  way if that was amazing we wouldn\\'t even  have to worry about those wrongly  because they were built now so that\\'s  2000 as of October of this year of those  two thousand hamady were planted prior  to the date that we raise the impact as  I answered earlier I don\\'t have the  actual chart with me but i can tell you  on an average the planning is owning  commission plants anywhere from one  hundred and  300 lots of months so you know from july  to to october roughly 300 300 las amo  200 lives less so there may be 800 watts  out there that would have been approved  since july possibly yeah that\\'s that\\'s  just an approximation okay and in the  only reason not right now I would  probably have to vote against this  unless but there\\'s but I think there is  something that we could do but I need to  get better numbers as to the legal  implications because it\\'s only going to  what we\\'ve been instructed by our city  attorney is that we cannot make we  cannot have unfettered discretion when  we make this decision but I guess we  could have fettered discretion I\\'m  assuming that the opposite of unfettered  is better and I\\'m not attorneys I\\'m just  trying to use the attorneys language  they that he gave us here so what you\\'re  saying mr. Paco is is that we just can\\'t  do this willy-nilly right that we have  to do this with on some basis that we  can justify there has to be some  criteria and I think there is some  criteria here I would be glad if I could  yield from your family\\'s bikini I would  be glad to postpone until the next  council meeting get more information if  if that is willing with most council  members up here i\\'d like to get all the  information certainly the statues of the  law but  think this is just an unfair if we can  get a second from mr. Nelson I think who  originally gave you a second and I  really want to real quickly because we  also we don\\'t we also have to consider  those lots that have already paid that  were previous because we may have to  refund money to those people so I need  so we need to have that analysis as well  and so are you clear only have some time  to make it make it clear for wait a  minute Mary wait wait wait wait we don\\'t  have to do that tonight emotion by  counsel cones is to postpone we will be  able to delouse you with data so that we  don\\'t have to go through all that  tonight where every councilman should  let you know exactly what we want to  make a decision councilman Collins has  amended his motion to postpone i would  say postponed indefinitely okay because  i don\\'t think we can make your next  council meeting but maybe the one after  okay Elsa you try to fit a key to my  questions or okay the motion before now  is to postpone until at least maybe the  secondary competing in December right be  meeting in December and second star  Councilman Jim Nelson we good with that  yep okay everybody in favor that please  vote for izz councilman kini barber Jim  Nelson maybe you Nelson and John Keenan  opposed is councilman chris jamison  motion passes we now move to item number  two in very much for thank you thank you  item number 10 e considering take action  concerning cities extraterritorial  jurisdiction negotiations we don\\'t need  a lotion on this story actually I just  wanted to update you as to where we are  in the process and yes we will be asking  you for some direction before so we know  how you want us to proceed and their  preservation project motion for  presentation okay council mccomas made a  motion presentation taking account from  Barbara okay present prior to mr. Pinto  leaving he briefed you on some meetings  that he had been I\\'m having with city  managers from surrounding cities as well  as judge Yarborough who is chairing  these meetings and the purpose of the  meetings is to try to clean up the ET je  overlapping boundaries between all of  the adjacent cities we have a continued  of these meetings since mr. Pinto is  left we attended a meeting on october  the 10th chris reed myself and we did  have the GIS person they\\'re with us as  well and we were there with all of the  representatives of the other cities  along with their attorney and arnold  Polanco represented the city of League  City as our attorney at that time we  discussed some of the issues that are  still active as far as ET je overlapping  boundaries just to kind of give you an  idea of what boundaries we are we going  to dim the lights a little bit so you  can kind of see where we are in a  wrinkle do a good job of helping me out  when he points to the area\\'s the purple  area that you see there is the area  that\\'s the ET je that\\'s shared by League  City and clear lake shores the blue area  is clear lake shores only that\\'s there  ET je and then there\\'s a green area  there in its League City only that area  has frontage on FM 518 however there are  no utilities available and the nearest  sewer is at least a mile away and in the  reddish area is kima ZT j only clear  lake shores at the october 10th meeting  made a proposal to league city what  clinic shores is proposing is that  league city would release the area above  the south line of the HL MP right away  and then clear lake shores would release  to league city the part of lawrence road  that is currently shared between  shores and leak city and then league  city would release everything that\\'s in  the green area to kemah in order for the  league city\\'s proposal is if leaks it is  to release that green area to kemah we  would be requesting that kima released  in area to league city near babe you  that would allow League City to have  access to the Galveston Bay as you know  we do have some area there but we have  no way to access the other day so that\\'s  one item that we will be proposing the  next issue involves Texas City I can say  that one more time I\\'m sorry what are  what are we asking of chemo we were  asking kima to release an area to us  that\\'s near the Bayview subdivision that  would allow League City to have access  to the Galveston Bay as you realize we  do have an area of land that fronts the  bay but we have no access to it because  it\\'s um owned by chemo you see the block  in the where rick is pointing we have no  access to to get to the property that  actually fronts the base so we would ask  kima to give us some access American oh  stop you right there we had access at  one time what happened to this that  corridor was not there before speaking  to the microcytic the annex a corridor  and I believe they block this and Lisa T  never  challenged we never challenged it when  kima annex that corridor some time ago  how much that land of Records ours I i  can think i think i can see it but if  you could highlight of different colors  in the yellow the yellow nicely texas  easy okay  we can provide these maps to you so you  can have them to look at at your leisure  as well we\\'ll be continuing the meet  with the surrounding cities it sounds  like the only thing that\\'s really  changed since the last meeting was is  that we have previously this and I\\'m  just discussing that the eastern part  not the Dickinson and all that but at  that time were we going to I think the  there was still some question about the  Galveston Bay property that was just  hadn\\'t been discussed yet or figured out  but is this green area that it says  clear lake shores to league city has  that changed now that was still partly  that\\'s still the same thing that was  previously associated right and so what  are we asking for from kemah I mean  we\\'re asking I know what we\\'re asking  for for FEMA what is kima asking far  from us that\\'s different than what was  previous nothing okay this issues really  coming down to between clear lake shores  and chemo yes and I would tend to come  along as well and this is just an FYI  they may or may not get along I\\'m i  guess i won\\'t stayed that tonight but  under any circumstance we can move  forward and then supposedly if we move  forward that might help sway their  opinion right but there\\'s no guarantee  what else are there\\'s not great but i  still go back to i mean i\\'ll have some  major concerns because we we had  continuous continuous connectivity from  babe you too  city do you recommend that was  councilman so we can research it when  mr. Poole an accident mr. Poole Mr  Bowles own counsel we had we had  continuous access from bayview to the  league city because that was the intent  was to have drainage out to the bay  we\\'ll go back and double-check that what  Rick and the engineering department has  done is that they pulled all of the  different annexation ordinances and try  and work with mr. Polanco to try to  track them and that\\'s the final map that  was that was I don\\'t see the the final I  would like to see the meetings because I  know the kemah once said that there were  some written correspondence that they  use that they couldn\\'t show proof of the  annexation so I would like to see them  we\\'ll go back and verify that for it for  our own and I\\'m based on those comments  how does this kima has I know there  hasn\\'t been any official agreement but  as came a scene I guess have they have  they agreed in principle to release that  is that I way 146 or anything yeah  that\\'s a you know if those meetings I  think everybody is I\\'m just putting  their issues out on the table and would  you say playing poker man I would say  that the game\\'s pretty much game set  match I don\\'t know that it\\'s going to  happen but it\\'s just it\\'s really beyond  our control it really comes down to  those two cities dude does chemo want  this portion of babe use that what  they\\'re trying to ask for actually kima  an extent and we\\'re just proposing that  they give us an access to it they  actually haven\\'t responded one way or  the other you\\'re saying the green  portion is leaked city or chemo the  green portions league city are they  asking for that portion of a you know  they are not if I may the purpose of  this meeting of this tonight we\\'ve all  the members this committee are going  back to counseling and giving this  overview because it\\'s very important  when we get down to the final agreement  that we all the council\\'s agree on  at the same time but it\\'s going to throw  it off so it it\\'s important that we have  a clear understanding of all this trade  issue and as the mayor had mentioned  earlier there regardless of their  agreements sir regardless of their  agreement on the east side leak city is  planning on still going ahead with our  trades right which may be a catalyst to  complete the deal go ahead so what we\\'re  proposing is give them the green here no  sir we\\'re keeping the green that\\'s ours  all right what are we proposing to give  chemo for that we\\'re not giving kima  anything they\\'re not asking for anything  or just remember to give us accidentally  off excess yes sir if we verify that we  don\\'t already have I think we have okay  there\\'s enough stuff clouded over by  years of being stuffed in a drawer i  think you know we\\'ve been trying to pull  it all out of the drawer sir to go to  the texas city dickinson area okay  currently the green that you see there  is League City see TJ the yellow is  Texas cities et J that\\'s east of  caroline street in then Texas City annex  this area in august 2005 and it was  later determined that they have NX in an  error because it actually belongs in to  league city in our ET je and so they are  d annex in this area and mr. pentell  told you about that at the last update  so nothing has changed their texas city  is proposing to release to dickinson the  area north of dickinson city limits and  west of gum by you league city will  release all of this ET je in this area  to dickinson and lisa has no utilities  in this area and right now people are  getting services from WC ID there are  some single-family homes out there  mobile homes that  dipinto described to you at the last  meeting nothing\\'s changed there and  areas not currently regulated by any  zoning so it\\'s just a mishmash of  development and the Makri port is out  there within the ET je area real far  east as well how far eastern 30 TJ go  he\\'s that\\'s as far east as about her  come by okay let me go and and that that  is the update that we have for you  tonight and we just wanted to see in  principle let you know that nothing had  changed this is what we\\'re still moving  forward with and to make sure that our  council is still wanting us to move in  this direction as the mayor stated a lot  of what happens between those two cities  has no bearing on what we want to do we  still need to clean up these ET je  boundaries so we can get rid of this  overlapping issues so we\\'re doing a  [ __ ] gratis right we will free would  be happy if they were to take it off our  hands I\\'m something a potion or two I  guess we could make a motion then start  the discussion on whether or not we  won\\'t staff to proceed what are you  looking for I mean that you can\\'t are  you want well the motions on the floor  for the presentation that\\'s all we  wanted to do tonight was just to keep  everybody a price of what well how does  that give feedback to staff that this  council is a dream to those actions  mer if I may I would like to see one  other thing I would like to see a more  defined complete mapping colored for  City Council to review i intend to drive  the area i think we have some major  concerns up here and we also invest  major concerns down the eastern in kemah  before i give up some property or ET je  to clear lake shores or chemo I mean we  have some concerns down there where that  property we\\'re taking over I would  certainly you know like to direct staff  to continue about I don\\'t think we\\'re  agreeing that we want to give up the  property yet no and that\\'s not what  we\\'re asking for I I would like to see  more definitive maps and cover of the  entire area that we can take a drive be  played on council agenda and in the  future for poor decision I guess what we  can do councilman is provide the council  with the mapping in sequence that our  authors did the GIS office did the  research on me show you the dates to the  different annexations that that I Rick  in the engineering staff researched I  would like to see like i said mr. Reed  clear maps in color showing the area  that we\\'re given up for training and  taking great because I do have some  concerns out there i would i would also  like to invite you november 16 today  thirty in the morning if you can it be  available we\\'re going to meet at the  weather station and that might help  having your input to would help us  greatly but if you\\'re going to attend  let us know because if there\\'s more than  four will have to talk what what is the  meeting into weather station that\\'s our  ET je meeting with the other city  representatives in the county jail and  this is a cat this is a judge all bro  initiative that he started about a year  ago and so it\\'s a you know it might not  hurt for some of the council to come I  thought that was on the twenty second  person  stand corrected the 22nd is it meramec  motion that we direct staff should move  forward with the DJ swap for councils  consideration of future council me okay  councilman Collins made a motion for  staff to continue to meet and discuss  the ET je issues and roll but we\\'re  going to unsee it back in front of  council again obviously it might be a  workshop issue if staff talks to council  and feels like it\\'s something that that  warrants an hour or so of discussion  will move to a workshop council and Jim  Nelson that is your second you insert it  okay any further discussion hearing none  please vote for izz unanimous motion  passes item 10 f consider taking action  to authorize the mayor to execute a  professional services contract with  Wallace Robertson thought to perform  professional planning services toward  the preparation of a rewrite of the sign  of wood glue for approval Councilman Jim  Nelson\\'s made motion to approve the  councilman chris sentence from the  second that motion is now open for  discussion hearing none please vote for  izz unanimous motion passes item 10 I  consider taking action on approval of  the parks and open space master plan  push recruit councilman Chris Emerson  has made a motion to approve particular  councilman Mike Barbour second that  motion is now over for discussion  nobody mayor I do have some concerns but  do we have a second reading on this is  this city ordinance no the next one this  is just the plan so that it\\'s not a more  but I do have concerns because I think  that we really need to workshop this  issue before will prove the claim a  master plan again okay just be clear  this is this was a just look on my  background it has been through parks  board unanimously approved the plan  january twenty third and then P&amp;C  unanimously approved it back in march  that\\'s mr. Severson of the workshop we  didn\\'t have workshop back in november  14th of 2005 meeting along with the  joint workshop with the Planning and  Zoning Commission of City Council and a  Parks Board has there been changes no  changes forever no sir and the marsh  board approved and unanimously in  January 2006 and the Planning Commission  actually approved it in March of 2006  and I\\'m at the park for Denise this plan  in order to start getting new grants in  and they really want to get this crew so  they can start getting some grants into  some part work but why does that stop  married that\\'s good for Texas Parks and  Wildlife has a requirement that you have  to have a parks plan is no older I want  to say five years and it\\'s been since  1999 255 since you\\'ve had a parks  national plan so we haven\\'t had any  grants from no sales no sir you haven\\'t  applied for any any new grants in a  while because you don\\'t not going to  Texas Parks and Wildlife because you  don\\'t have an updated parks clean thank  you okay the most on the floors by  counseling Sanderson\\'s who approves  seconded by councilman Mike Barbour with  no further discussion please vote for  its unanimous motion passes item 10 Jay  consider take action on an ordinance  amending ordinance number 200 356  section 102.5 110 2.59 article 2 of the  city of League cities code of ordinances  and title parks and recreation areas  some of helping Jim Nelson play the  motion to approve seconded by councilman  chris henderson it\\'s open for debate  we\\'re the only question I have is get to  it it\\'s the it\\'s the area in there that  talks about the time that 102 dash 56  and mr. chambers maybe you can kind of  mr. Cheng and help you if you could just  kind of tell me the significance and  what that what this section really means  102 dash 56 or says land shown on a  subdivision master plan by a developer  for a major recreational center school  site park or other public use shall be  reserved for a period of one year after  the preliminary plan is approved by the  sea what\\'s the significance of this um  man can with what we\\'ve seen happening  in the past is that you will get a  master plan approval developer would  have a master plan approved and he was  set aside land or those particular uses  that you so mentioned and then would  revise his master plan and those uses  would move or get lessons so this is to  make sure that for a period of one year  we know that that land is available for  that development and then what we\\'ve  done in the subdivision orders to try to  make all these ordinances work together  is now if that master plan changes to  the extent that that land shifts we have  to have another public hearing and  notify those surrounding property owners  so you don\\'t move into a neighborhood  thinking that you\\'re going to have a  park and all of a sudden you don\\'t have  part it\\'s something else in that period  well I think that\\'s great I\\'m just  concerned that maybe one years not long  is not long enough and when if the  master it says the hood is the master  plan so if they revise their master plan  and let\\'s say remove  wanted to remove a school site for  example after one year they can does  this say that they can do that in our  one year they can then what happens is  because the this section is also within  the subdivision ordinance the parks  section is 10 chapter 1 or 2 is also our  subdivision ordinance so then that would  kick into the river what\\'s with all  solar guys right so what we\\'ve done is  we\\'ve written into the subdivision  ordinance which is chapter 10 to that if  that does change then you have to have a  public hearing which we would notify the  surrounding property on us so that  people in the neighborhood know that  there\\'s not going to be a school there  is the identical towards it says here  yes we what we\\'ve done is married the  two the two ordinances they were very  competing at one right now as they  currently stand there very competing  although they\\'re animals in there yeah  this was in the previous one right and  and it\\'s still in the current one and  I\\'m just concerned that that\\'s that\\'s it  doesn\\'t where does it say in here about  the public hearing doesn\\'t in this  section of the subdivision orders when  you get the new revised subdivision  ordinance which you\\'ll get at the next  council meeting you will see where we  piggyback with the tooth but if it\\'s  identical why don\\'t we just have it the  one because the P&amp;C was still working on  the soap it\\'s the same ordinance chapter  10 2 is the subdivision ordinance this  is just a portion of it okay the parks  playing parts ordinances a portion of  the sub provisional okay thank you  motion on the floor is by Councilman Jim  Nelson to approve seconded by councilman  chris henderson and with no further  discussion please vote for izz unanimous  motion passes mkay considers a catch on  the approval of a requisition for the  upgrade to the current meter reading  system laptop as well as an additional  handheld meter reading device remove  hello Jim Nelson\\'s made motion to  approve very second that motion and  Councilman kinis second that motion open  for discussion well the question is was  why was it this one it\\'s a legitimate  don\\'t know if that\\'s a good question  real heavy idea in fact you should I\\'m  not sure should have needed to be on the  consent agenda but I don\\'t think it  needed to be on our council yeah so  we\\'ll talk about that but for now it\\'s a  it\\'s a good question so crispy note that  please we\\'ve got it first in a second  and with no further discussion please  vote for is unanimous motion passes item  11 consider take action one ordinance  amending chapter 22 the city of League  City Code of Ordinances entitled the  buildings and building regulations by  amending article 7 section 22 33 1  through section 221 335 we\\'re to approve  for discussion councilman cosmic motion  to approve seconded by Councilman John  Keene emotions over dispense  announcement Pelham\\'s para have a  question for mr. lenders  this kind of song I agree with most of  the change but we\\'re taking out the  duties of the building official is  better by looking at the exhibit under  exhibit a this exhibit a is your new  city ordinance which ER you\\'re trying to  pass correct yes sir and you\\'re deleting  section 22 dash 331 all the way through  335 is that correct that\\'s correct okay  and then we\\'re replacing it with the new  world with the new ordinance but it it  took out some of your the only thing I\\'m  concerned way to check out some of you  languages of the duties of building  officials I mean I understand what the  intent of the code is trying to improve  the substandard buildings that we have  in our city and so forth was their  reason why we took out 10 23 32 but  those sections will also be addressed  and unsafe structure building section  that\\'s also kind of being adopted in the  section 108 it in that section it\\'s not  actually in here for reference by  reference and what that does is that  gives some of those powers back to the  building can you can you show me where  you\\'re talking about under exhibit area  you\\'re saying yeah under unsafe  structures definition there\\'s a  definition for that and then it goes  through okay surely sir  well i\\'m sorry i\\'m giving you  misinformation that\\'s not that just  defines unsafe structures yeah that was  my concern Shona it looks like that we  may understand it I mean I\\'m not exactly  what section are you referring to where  I\\'m taking away the powers from us well  you\\'re taking away section 22 dash 332  duties of the building official yes and  you\\'re you\\'re taking that entire article  out of the city codes and you\\'re  adopting section 25 30 31 minimum  standards team but there\\'s nowhere in  here I see worried is defined in the  duties of the building official back  into the new code number some way I love  them I\\'m somewhat concerned it looks  like you made a lower right here where  it talks about hearings I mean that it\\'s  given me the powers to schedule their  hearings and to bring everything forward  in 22 33 34 talks about hearings the  building official may schedule here in  the for the Zoning Board I mean  basically what this ordinance is also  we\\'re going to do is the board is going  to make the decisions on what  substandard and what\\'s not I mean it\\'s  taking a lot of power i would say yes  it\\'s taking a lot of power away from the  building official and in the built in  the city staff of determining this is  substandard we\\'re going to go out  identify those items those properties  and then we\\'re going to bring it forward  to the board and the board will then  make those decisions so it will actually  be a board of citizens making the  decision to this staff and i agree with  that i agree with the new ordinance the  only thing I\\'m concerned with you are  taking the duties of the building  official completely out of the ordinance  and I don\\'t see any reference in new  ordinance that it it gives you that  definition of I mean it states here at  the building official she\\'ll perform  such duties as directed by the city  council mayor in the city administrators  order about the Thunder  adjustments your articles are one of the  sony Gordon\\'s that was adopted last year  there is a total subsection in there  that discusses the building official and  his powers and duties we move that  section to the zoning ordinance that you  adopted last year what okay so it\\'s not  in this order yet but different okay I  guess the only question I have is in  that same where you just brought that up  Shawn I guess it\\'s the building official  shale schedule I mean that\\'s the way  we\\'re going to determine all right  that\\'s correct the only way we\\'re going  to de transcript so it\\'s not really you  may schedule or going to shell and we  want to give everybody their due process  good intent of this ordinance instead of  the city staff making those  determinations and then get challenged  in court we would rather give them due  process through Z be a lezzie be a  determine that it is substandard and  they even have the ability to decide  timelines on when something needs to be  demoed or if they get time to come  bringing it in compliance there\\'s  different elements that gets the board  the ability to accomplish that way and  they they\\'ll determine that through the  definitions of unsafe structure yes sir  and through your the information that  you provide and the owner will provide  that\\'s correct I mean the old ordnance  why we went through this process that  old ordinance was very vague and it left  a lot of area for liability for the city  I mean if we I went out and filed a lien  pour down somebody\\'s property really we  were it was very vague on how that was  taken care of and we wanted to make it  more defined more pronounced in this  ordinance we\\'re actually a substandard  structure is very defined in this  ordinance okay let me just take like the  very first one b1a it says when any door  I\\'ll passageway stairway or other means  of exit is not sufficient width or is so  arranged as to provide is not so  arranged us to provide safe and adequate  means of exit in case of a fire or panic  what\\'s the width the code requires 44  inches in most instances it depends on  if it\\'s a residential use of commercial  use I mean will fall back to the  building codes that for those  definitions I mean those those Wiz and  doorways number of egress doors all that  stuff\\'s in the building codes themselves  and we\\'ll be able to fall back to those  codes to make those determinations on  how wide it needs to be here items like  that 44 inches for a commercial uses of  egress with this 44 inches and this  stills with commercial and residential  and residential I mean this is any  substandard structure could be a  commercial building our residential  building for residential use it\\'s  usually 36 inches for a highway our  first stair motion on the floor by  Councilman cones to approve seconded by  Councilman teeny with no further debate  please vote for unanimous motion passes  they keep item 12 there\\'s 9 13 there\\'s  nine item 14 the mayor\\'s comments of  just a couple of quick things I\\'d like  to say that chief Daniels put on a an  event this weekend this past weekend for  the veterans day work with very closely  with John Kilgore and unveiled a  monument to all of the fallen heroes  that have lived in league city I believe  there were nine and I know that a  previous administration previous council  had approved those funds and I think it  is an absolutely magnificent gesture for  us and again the backbone of the city is  is the people that live here there was a  great turnout Keith it was a great event  I know you went to great lengths to do  that and thank you for your efforts the  only other thing is for all the people  that have asked I got my hair cut by the  Chamber of Commerce because they got 125  new members I\\'m not sick if thanks for  asking just when you thought I could be  better looking at  what can I say however my new challenge  to the Chamber of Commerce if you\\'re  watching is that I now challenge you to  nobody in the chamber get another  haircut and so you get another 125  minutes so challenge issues with no  further issues 16 17 as there are none  this meeting is a jerk  you {00:00:30}\"'"
